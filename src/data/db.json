      "article_body": "LONDON, Jan Reuters West Ham United missed out on a fourth successive Premier League victory as the festive fixtures concluded with a drab draw at home to Brighton Hove Albion on Tuesday. Brighton would have moved above West Ham into sixth place with a victory but chances were few and far between at the London Stadium with a point apiece a fair outcome. Pascal Gross should have put Brighton in front shortly before halftime but his header was saved by Alphonse Areola while Adam Lallana went close to a late winner. Pablo Fornals should have done better for the hosts after the break and Tomas Soucek also prodded an effort wide. In the end West Ham, without African Cup of Nationsbound Mohammed Kudus and injured fellow midfielder Lucas Paqueta, appeared content to take the draw which left them in sixth spot with points from games. Brighton's first clean sheet of the season in the league moved them above Manchester United into seventh on goal difference with points. While the game will not live long in the memory, both sides can embrace the New Year optimistically with European honours still possible and a challenge for a topsix place in the Premier League. \"It was disappointing from our point of view because I think we controlled the game and created enough chances,\" Brighton's yearold midfielder James Milner told Sky Sports. \"But it was a solid performance especially with a couple of boys coming back who haven't had too much football.\" The evergreen Milner was making his nd Premier League appearance to move level with Ryan Giggs and only Gareth Barry has played more matches in the competition West Ham won the reverse fixture earlier in the season ending a match winless streak against Brighton. But they could not earn a first topflight win at home against the southcoast club since . \"We had a couple of chances. Tomas Soucek had a great chance,\" West Ham boss David Moyes said. \"We rode our luck a wee bit. It's been a really good Christmas period, three wins and a draw. No complaints.\"",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters England women's goalkeeper Mary Earps, Glastonbury music festival founder Michael Eavis and the widow of children's author Roald Dahl were among hundreds of people recognised by Britain in King Charles' New Year honours list. The trio were among more than , people who were honoured for community services and services to the fields of health, sport and the arts, the government said on Friday. Earps, , who helped England to the World Cup final earlier this year in Australia and was named the best keeper at the tournament, received an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire. Eavis, who started Glastonbury festival in on his farm in southwest England, was knighted in recognition for his services to music and charity. Felicity Dahl, who set up a children's charity in memory of her late husband Roald Dahl in , was awarded a damehood, the female equivalent of a knighthood. The New Year's honours, which have been awarded since Queen Victoria's reign in the th century, aim to recognise not just wellknown figures but people who have contributed to national life through often unsung work over many years. Sarah Graham, who runs a community group hosting Ukrainian refugees in southern England, was awarded an MBE, while nineyearold Tony Hudgell was awarded a BEM, or British Empire Medal, for services to the prevention of child abuse. Pop singer Leona Lewis was given an OBE, or Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for contribution to music and philanthropic work, and singer Shirley Bassey, already a dame, was made a member of the Order of the Companion of Honour. Britishborn national security expert Fiona Hill, who as a former adviser to thenU.S. President Donald Trump testified in his impeachment inquiry in , was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George CMG for \"exceptional and sustained career contributions\".",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Michael Olise struck twice as Crystal Palace beat Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday to snap an eightgame run without a win and ease the pressure on manager Roy Hodgson. The winger scored either side of halftime, cancelling out Keane LewisPotter's early opener with a fine volley before doubling the hosts' lead with another good finish. Palace climbed above Brentford into th on points after games, while defeat for the Bees their fifth in a row put them th on points after matches. Hodgson hailed his players for recovering from the early goal to show both offensive ability and defensive grit. \"I thought some of the attacking play was very good and then we had to show the other side of our game towards the end,\" he told reporters. Hodgson was full of praise for Olise, saying the winger performance was \"a crucial one I think in helping us to get the victory\". Asked if he had felt any pressure in recent weeks, Hodgson replied \"No. I think about the match and what needs to be done. \"There's no point, you can't affect the outside noise. If the noise isn't directed at me it would be directed at somebody else because that's part and parcel of the game.\" Brentford had led inside two minutes through LewisPotter's second goal of the season, the forward diverting Mads Roerslev's cross into the net at full stretch after a quick break though it took three minutes for VAR to confirm the goal was not offside. Palace levelled after minutes through Olise, with his initial cross recycled by Jordan Ayew whose ball to the back post was finished by the winger from a tight angle. Eberechi Eze gave the home side the lead six minutes before the break when he powered into the box and slotted his finish low beyond keeper Mark Flekken. Olise doubled his tally in the th minute, cutting inside from the left and firing home from the edge of the box a minute after forcing a good save from Flekken. Brentford substitute Neal Maupay incessantly booed having played for Palace's rivals Brighton rattled the bar and home keeper Dean Henderson had to claw out a looping ball as the Bees tried to find a way back into the game. But Palace withstood the late pressure and deservedly took the points for only their second home league win this season. Brentford boss Thomas Frank said he was \"burning inside\" after another defeat, but that he was pleased by his injuryravaged side's performance. \"No complaints about the effort or mentality from the players,\" he told reporters. \"I think in a lot of areas we did quite well but the decisive factor today was the quality in both boxes.\"",

      "article_body": "Jan Reuters Arsenal need to build a stronger ingame mentality, midfielder Declan Rice said after the north London club dropped points in backtoback matches with a defeat against Fulham on Sunday, hurting their Premier League title challenge. Arsenal failed to capitalise on an early lead given by Bukayo Saka at Craven Cottage, slipping to fourth place on points at the halfway stage of the campaign, having lost at home against West Ham United on Thursday. While there may be pressure from reigning champions Manchester City and this season's surprise package Aston Villa's victories over the weekend, Rice said Arsenal will not hit the panic button. \"When you go up, you need to take more control and have more selfbelief,\" Rice told Sky Sports. \"You need to have more desire, the mentality needs to be better. We need to demand more for each other. \"In this league, there's no room to mess up. There's so many good teams around you and we want to be pushing up the top end of the table. It's a tough one to take today.\" Arsenal are not fixated on the points table, Rice added. Villa moved up to points, the same as Liverpool, who lead on goal difference and host Newcastle United later on Monday, while City sit third with a game in hand. \"There's a lot of media who talk and say 'Arsenal will win the league this year, Arsenal are better this year', and whatnot. But we don't get involved in that, we just try to take every game as we can, one by one,\" Rice said. \"We've been doing really well. There's been a blip in the road, but there's no room to panic. There's still so many games to go, we need to stay positive. It's not the time to be negative.\"",

United had a rollercoaster festive period, beating Aston Villa with a stunning comeback before a meek defeat at Nottingham Forest that kept the pressure on Ten Hag following the takeover of United by Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS group. Ten Hag met Ratcliffe for the first time. \"We had a long meeting, so many hours we sit together, on many issues we were on the same page, very positive from both sides,\" the manager said. \"I can say that it was a very constructive meeting and we're looking forward to working with each other.\" Ten Hag said it was too early to expect much change to the team under the new ownership. \"We have to let it settle down, they're just coming in, introducing themselves,\" he said. \"They have good ideas, we have to see what we can integrate. In togetherness we will work, but after one day you can't tell that. \"They have given me a few of their ideas, we have had our debates about strategies and I think we will come together.\" United have triggered options on contract extensions for Aaron WanBissaka, Victor Lindelof and Hannibal Mejbri, Ten Hag said, adding that they were \"talking with\" Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial. Ten Hag said there was no news on Jadon Sancho's potential loan move to his former club Borussia Dortmund. Sancho has not played for United since late August when he complained about his treatment on social media after Ten Hag criticised his performances in training. United, eliminated from Europe and the League Cup, have won the FA Cup times, most recently in .",

The inconsistency that has plagued United's season continued at the City Ground as they lost their ninth Premier League game out of to remain seventh in the table, points behind leaders Liverpool. United have lost games in all competitions this season, their most defeats by the turn of the year since after suffering their first loss at Forest in years. \"Manchester United are so inconsistent,\" Jamie Redknapp said Sky Sports. \"They are horrible to watch. They have no real appetite, desire, it looks like they are playing under duress. There's not enough ambition or desire. Former United defender Gary Neville agreed. \"There's no pattern of play,\" Neville said. \"I'm struggling to see what they are trying to do.\" The numbers are bleak. United have lost nine of their opening league games in a season for the first time since , as many as they suffered all last season in manager Erik Ten Hag's debut campaign. \"We were overperforming last year, this year so far we are underperforming, we have to do better, we have to step up and I have to lead the process,\" said Ten Hag, whose team won the League Cup and finished third in the league last season. United, out of Europe and the League Cup, have accumulated points, nine adrift of fourthplaced Arsenal who have played one fewer game. Only Burnley and Sheffield United have scored fewer goals than Ten Hag's team. \"The ranking doesn't lie but you have seen we went headtohead with Arsenal, Liverpool and Aston Villa,\" Ten Hag said. The loss at Forest kept the pressure on Ten Hag following the takeover of United by Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS group. Dave Brailsford, INEOS's director of sport and now a United director, watched the game at Forest. \"Definitely, he will see that we have our problems and you want to build on the Boxing Day win, but then again, you have to replace your striker,\" Ten Hag said. United forward Rasmus Hojlund missed the Forest match due to illness after scoring his first Premier League goal of the season against Villa.",

There are no Premier League matches this weekend, with the FA Cup third round taking precedence, while all clubs will have one of the two following weekends off in a mini winter break. Everton played eight games in all competitions in December but will play a maximum of just four this month, beginning with their trip to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup later on Thursday. \"I don't see the point of it when you've just had so many games in December. It's not that beneficial,\" Dyche told reporters on Wednesday. \"It would be better to lose one or two of these games in December and put them in there to spread it out. That's a better scenario. It's a more level playing field then. With more games, the big clubs are bound to gain because of their big squads. \"But when you haven't got a big squad, like us, and you get injuries, you're bound to be stretched. If you put a couple of games in that break then it is more level across the season. \"I'll be surprised if that break doesn't disappear, just from the scheduling.\"",

      "article_body": "MILAN, Dec Reuters Italy's government late on Thursday dropped a draft proposal that would have extended until the end of February tax breaks of up to on the wages of sport clubs' new signings from abroad, drawing criticism from the country's top soccer league. The measure, which is now due to expire on Dec. , has been in place since early and was especially tailored to Italy's Serie A topflight soccer league. Its phasing out means Italian clubs will not be able to rely on the tax breaks for foreign signings they make during the coming January transfer window. Serie A, which had lobbied for an extension of the benefit, said the government's decision would be counterproductive. \"Failing to extend the measure ... will in fact make the teams less competitive, resulting in a drop in revenues, fewer resources to be allocated to young players' academies, reduced industry volumes and therefore less revenue for the country's inland revenue,\" it said in a statement. Players' salaries are the most important cost in the balance sheets of Serie A clubs, and backers of the incentives said they helped Italian teams attract top foreign talent and compete with richer peers like England's Premier League. Lazio chair Claudio Lotito, who is also a senator for the coruling Forza Italia party, lobbied for the tax breaks to be maintained, but was rebuffed by government coalition partners, including the League. \"Discounts to foreign footballers earning millions are immoral, clubs should invest in young Italian players and not overpay foreigners who are also often bad players,\" League lawmaker Luca Toccalini said in a statement.",

Spurs are now left without their best two central defenders, with Dutchman Micky van de Ven sidelined since early November and not expected to return until next month. James Maddison, Ivan Perisic, Ryan Sessegnon, Manor Solomon, Rodrigo Bentancur and Ashley Phillips are the other longterm absentees. \"If we can do business early, it's great for us. Not just because of losing Romero but there's a whole month there why waste it,\" Postecoglou told reporters ahead of Thursday's trip to Brighton Hove Albion. \"If you can bring them in early, even if they don't play, you can bed them into training and our style of football because it's not like we're going to sign somebody and they'll hit the ground running. \"Whereas if you leave it towards the end of January, it's potentially not until mid to end of February when they get up to speed, depending where they're coming from, the league they're coming from, so there's a whole lot of moving parts.\" Spurs will also lose skipper and South Korean forward Son Heungmin when he departs for the Asian Cup, which will take place from Jan. Feb. in Qatar. The Premier League transfer market will open on January and wrap up by February . \"I'd love to do something early in the window, but even me saying that puts a challenge on us because other clubs know we want to do something early,\" the Australian added. Having started the season in scintillating form before being hobbled by injuries, Spurs are now fifth in the standings with points from matches, just a point behind Manchester City.",

      "article_body": "BOURNEMOUTH, England, Dec Reuters A resurgent Bournemouth moved into the top half of the Premier League standings with a home win over Fulham on Tuesday thanks to goals by Justin Kluivert, Dominic Solanke and Luis Sinisterra. Andoni Iraola's side were winless in their first nine league games of the season, but the suspended Spaniard watching the contest from the stands was all smiles as they sealed their sixth win in seven matches. The result moved Bournemouth up to th with points from matches while Fulham are th following their third straight defeat without scoring. \"Now we are flying. The whole squad, we've got a great team, great spirit,\" Kluivert told Amazon Prime. \"It's wonderful. We've got to know each other. I'm new, the coach is new. At the beginning we were struggling, we were losing but we've found our feet.\" Bournemouth had numerous chances early on, with Fulham's Tosin Adarabioyo denying Kluivert with a lunging block around the halfhour mark. A minute later, an outofposition Bernd Leno in Fulham's goal spilled the ball but Solanke's shot was deflected for a corner by Adarabioyo's header. Bournemouth increased the pressure on Fulham, earning backtoback corners over the next few minutes, and their efforts finally paid off just before halftime. Alex Scott took the ball along the halfway line and sprinted right through the Fulham defence to set up Kluivert's shot that was hit directly at Leno, but the German could not hold on to it as the deadlock was broken at Vitality Stadium. Bournemouth doubled their lead after the hourmark when Joao Palhinha's foul on Antonie Semenyo gave the home side a rare penalty, their first in nearly months, which Solanke converted for his th league goal of the season. Solanke moved level with Liverpool's Mohamed Salah in the league's scoring charts, two behind top scorer Erling Haaland of Manchester City. With Fulham down and out, secondhalf substitute Sinisterra put the cherry on top when he curled in their third goal in stoppage time to seal the win. \"Disappointing result, really disappointing second half, too. Bournemouth deserved it,\" Fulham manager Marco Silva said. \"We have to be more aggressive... the penalty was not necessary. After that we didnt create chances. We didn't punish them. \"When you concede goals the way we did, we don't deserve to get any points from the game,\" he added. Bournemouth visit Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday while Fulham host Arsenal.",

Madueke was brought down by Eberechi Eze who caught the Chelsea midfielder's trailing leg and, after initially waving play on, referee Michael Salisbury was called by VAR to the screen where he signalled a foul. Palace's Michael Olise had shown fine skill when unmarked at the far post he chested down Jordan Ayew's pass and finished deftly past Djordje Petrovic in firsthalf stoppage time. The goal cancelled out a thminute strike from Chelsea forward Mykhailo Mudryk who turned in a low cross from Malo Gusto. Mudryk looked lively in an energetic firsthalf display by the home side, but after the late goal and halftime break, Chelsea appeared to lose momentum. Crystal Palace's defence snuffed out attacks and Mauricio Pochettino's Chelsea were often reduced to passing triangles outside their opponents' area, though they did have a thminute goal from Nicolas Jackson ruled out by VAR for offside. \"Credit to Crystal Palace, they played some good stuff and were difficult to break down,\" Madueke told Amazon Prime. \"But credit to us too, we deserved it.\" Chelsea squeezed into the top half of the table halfway through the season, reaching th while Palace, who have not won in the Premier League for eight games, remained in th place.",

      "article_body": "BRIGHTON, England, Dec Reuters Tottenham Hotspur's topfour ambitions suffered a blow as they lost at Brighton Hove Albion in the Premier League on Thursday with only a late rally saving them from their heaviest defeat since Ange Postecoglou became manager this season. Victory would have put injuryhit Spurs above Manchester City into fourth spot but they were mauled on the south coast as a Brighton side also missing key players ran riot. A powerful early strike by Josh Hinshelwood and Joao Pedro's penalty gave the hosts a deserved lead at halftime as Tottenham struggled to deal with Brighton's intensity. The visitors responded in the second half with Richarlison having a goal disallowed but when halftime substitute Pervis Estupinan sent a thunderbolt past Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario and Joao Pedro netted a second penalty the game seemed over. However, Tottenham's late substitute Alejo Veliz fired home from close range in the th minute and Ben Davies scored with a header making a miraculous comeback suddenly look possible. Midfielder PierreEmile Hojbjerg hit the post for Spurs in stoppage time as Brighton looked nervy but they held on to move into eighth place in the table on points while Tottenham remain fifth on , a point off the top four. The final scoreline hardly did justice to a chaotic match in which Tottenham were secondbest for long periods but showed some spirit to emerge with their pride intact. However Brighton, without the likes of winger Kaoru Mitoma, Tariq Lamptey, Solly March and Julio Enciso, were worthy winners as they snapped a threematch league sequence without a win. \"It is a very disappointing performance. This is not how we've approached the season,\" Spurs captain Son Heungmin said. \"This performance was nowhere near the level we want to play at. But now is not the time to point fingers at each other because the games are coming fast.\" Tottenham host inform Bournemouth on Sunday when they will be without Kulusevski who will be suspended after picking up another booking, while Brighton visit West Ham United on Jan. . Tottenham's defensive problems, made worse by Argentine centre back Cristian Romero having been added to their long injury list, were exposed by Brighton as the hosts dominated the first half with some slick, highintensity football. Vicario had already made two fine saves before Hinshelwood was played in by Joao Pedro on the edge of the area and thumped an unstoppable shot high into the net. Brighton almost doubled their lead when Jan Paul van Hecke's header hit the post and as the ball rebounded towards Danny Welbeck the striker was blatantly pulled back by Dejan Kulusevski with a penalty being awarded after a VAR check. Joao Pedro rolled the rdminute spot kick past Vicario to put Brighton in command although Richarlison nearly responded just before halftime with a shot that kissed the post. Spurs looked brighter after the break and wasted several chances before Brazilian Richarlison netted, only to have his joy cut short as VAR showed he was offside. Estupinan made it with a sensational strike from outside the area before Tottenham substitute Giovani Lo Celso conceded a penalty that Joao Pedro dispatched. A raft of substitutions revived Spurs with Bryan Gil and Veliz adding some energy to the visitors and the latter celebrated wildly as he slotted his first goal for the club. Davies headed in from close range and Tottenham then had numerous chances to try to grab an unlikely point although they can have no real complaints about leaving empty handed.",

Chelsea have lost their last four away games in the league and though Luton is no easy place to visit, Pochettino is taken by the charm of the ground, one of the smallest in England's top flight. \"I am an old man, I'm a romantic, I love the football from the past. And these kind of stadiums remind you when you start to play... These stadiums smell different,\" Pochettino told reporters. \"They are not the luxury that we recognise today but these are the stadiums where you love to be there. Today we live in a different era with new stadium, but you go there and you feel real football. \" Although Luton are th in the standings, they have posed a tough challenge at home with Liverpool settling for a draw while Arsenal and Manchester City came from behind to seal narrow victories. Pochettino expects his side also to find it difficult against Rob Edwards' side. \"The stadium, the fans and it's a team who like to fight and work really hard. And it's so difficult if you watch the last few games in their stadium, it was tough for all the opponents,\" Pochettino added. \"If we want to get some good results, we have to be ready to play some good football. But we also have to match their desire, their capacity to fight for every single ball. And it's going to be a good test for us. \"Throughout the year we've struggled against teams like Luton... For me, I'm happy to play there because it will be a good challenge for our young team and it will be a good experience.\" Pochettino also confirmed that longtime absentee Romeo Lavia, who came off the bench for his debut in Wednesday's win over Crystal Palace, is injured again. Ukrainian winger Mykhailo Mudryk is also a doubt and the Argentine manager said both players will be assessed ahead of the game.",

Secondhalf goals from Wilson Odobert and Sander Berge earned Burnley their third victory of the Premier League season and helped Kompany's side move off the bottom of the table. The Belgian manager spoke with Welch after the match, and when asked about what he had said, Kompany told reporters \"I wanted to congratulate her because it's a big moment. \"After the game it's fair to say that it's a milestone moment and may there be more, and the best thing will always be when someone is judged on merit. \"But you have to have a first and this is it, so well done to her and I'm happy to be part of this moment.\" Welch has been a trailblazer for female referees and last month was the fourth official for Fulham v Manchester United in the Premier League, the first female to fulfil that role. The yearold, a regular in the Women's Super League, has previously officiated in the Football League and the FA Cup and was on duty at the women's World Cup this year.",

Corica won backtoback championships with Sydney FC in but departed last month after a poor start to the season. He will work with the Auckland team's recently appointed director of football Terry McFlynn, a former Sydney FC team mate, to build the club's roster before they join the Australian top flight from the season. The team's billionaire owner Bill Foley said Corica was a \"proven winner\" as a player and a head coach. \"His philosophy is aligned with what we want to achieve at the club, to be successful and to entertain the fan,\" Foley said in a statement. Auckland will join fellow New Zealanders Wellington Phoenix, the first time the nation has had two teams in the ALeague. Wellington top the table eight games into the season.",

On Wednesday, the German called out the quiet Anfield crowd for both their league draw with Manchester United and a League Cup rout of West Ham United, saying if fans were \"not in the right shape, give your ticket to somebody else\". He clarified his comment on Friday, saying it was not a criticism. \"I enjoyed . of each second in that stadium, but if we can do better, that is all,\" Klopp told reporters. \"I said give your ticket to someone else but people tell me it's not that easy. I didn't mean it literally. I said we need Anfield, that is true and I cannot wait for the first whistle. \"So it's a massive game, great. We have to make sure we make it a proper home game and a proper Anfield experience, that is all I want.\" Liverpool are second in the standings on points. They have turned Anfield into a fortress, going undefeated at home in more than a year. While last Sunday's goalless draw was a frustrating outcome, Klopp pointed out his team created numerous chances, with shots combined in the Manchester United and West Ham games. \"That is pretty special I would say and that is what football is all about,\" Klopp said. \"Imagine if we'd have scored with all of them, that is ridiculous. \"When I turned around after we missed a chance, everyone was flat and I was like, 'What do you want Creating a chance is as close as you can get to scoring a goal'. \"We should enjoy this time as we are in a pretty good position in the league, maybe quicker than people expect. And then the difference for me is that we have a chance and we miss it, it's 'ugh'. But usually after that, the stadium goes bonkers, because immediately we go for the next chance. And that was different. It was.\" Mikel Arteta's side top the league on points although thirdplaced Aston Villa can climb above them at least temporarily with a victory on Friday against visiting Sheffield United. Arsenal have not won a Premier League match at Anfield since , although they are on a run of five wins in six league games. \"They are really well coached and well drilled. They have taken another step this year and will have my respect, but we want the points,\" the German said. Klopp was also asked about Thursday's European Court of Justice ruling that UEFA and FIFA contravened EU law when they prevented the formation of a Super League. Liverpool were among the clubs who said they supported UEFA. \"I agree with the statement,\" he said. \"I also like that we finally get an understanding that UEFA and other FAs can't just do what they want, putting in more games with people having no say in it. I like that they've got a bit of a shake.\"",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters In their quest to capture their first Club World Cup title, Manchester City have been studying footage of Brazilian opponent Fluminense as they are unfamiliar with their style of play, manager Pep Guardiola said. Adding to the stiff challenge, City will be without Premier Leagueleading striker Erling Haaland, who travelled to Saudi Arabia despite having missed City's past four games with a nagging foot injury. Haaland was sidelined for City's semifinal win over Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds on Tuesday, and his absence means he is ineligible to play in the rest of the competition even if he was fit to play. \"We try in the hours after our last game to see Fluminense as much as possible, looking at the quality they have,\" Guardiola told reporters on Thursday in Jeddah. \"They have five, six or seven players more than yearsold so that means they can control their emotions perfectly. \"They play a typical Brazilian style from the s, 's and 's. Lots of short passes, combining really good, but also physically demanding. We have to be aware how much they run behind the ball, and be resilient in handling that. \"The way they play demands a lot of effort from us. The way they play we have never faced before. They move a lot from side to side, so we have to impose our own rhythm and possession game as much as possible.\" City have struggled lately, winning only one of their last six Premier League games to drop to fourth in the table, yet are considered the favourites to hoist what would be their fifth trophy over the past year on Friday. Guardiola said a key to victory will be keeping a tight rein on their emotions. \"How do you play a Club World Cup final without emotion\" Guardiola said. \"Emotion is there, it's how you handle it. It's there. It's how long it stays in your mind. That's the big target in finals.\" Guardiola has impressed on the players that winning the Cup is a \"onceinalifetime\" opportunity. \"The players are ready and know how important it is. As I have said before, what a pleasure it is to be here,\" said the Spaniard, adding the team enjoyed a rare dinner together on Wednesday evening. City defender Kyle Walker said a victory on Friday would be a terrific way to cap a remarkable months during which they have won the Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League and UEFA Super Cup. \"I have experienced a lot of career highs, but it would top off what we did last season winning the treble as a group of lads that have spent a lot of years together working towards the right direction,\" the yearold said. \"It would be on par with one of my greatest achievements.\"",

      "article_body": "MADRID, Dec Reuters Getafe fought back to grab a draw at man Atletico Madrid on Tuesday as Borja Mayoral scored his second with a stoppagetime penalty to level a pulsating LaLiga encounter in which Antoine Griezmann equalled the hosts' alltime scoring record. France international Griezmann also bagged a brace to draw level with Luis Aragones as the club's record marksman with goals, but it wasn't enough to take all three points as Getafe clawed their way back from down. It was the first time Diego Simeone's side, who had Stefan Savic sent off in the thminute, dropped points at home this season. They next host Sevilla on Saturday. \"After playing every three days and being down to men with so much time to play, the boys made a huge effort. It was a tough game, we knew that,\" Atletico manager Simeone told DAZN. \"I am absolutely delighted for Griezmann, a player who is part of the club's history. He has always given everything and is very important for us.\" Atletico moved third in the table with points, level with fourthplaced Barcelona, who host Almeria on Wednesday. Girona are top with points. \"It's a shame, we had made a great effort with men. It's a shame that Savic fouled twice and got two yellow cards. We wanted the three points,\" said Griezmann. \"We are always fighting for the league, there is peace of mind. There are games that you win, others that you end up suffering. There is no fatigue, we are very happy.\" Atletico took the lead just before halftime as Griezmann scored with a closerange finish from Rodrigo Riquelme's superb cross from the right. Getafe equalised eight minutes into the second half when Mayoral, the league's second top scorer, pounced on a rebound from keeper Jan Oblak's superb save to find the net with a fine header. Atletico substitute Alvaro Morata restored their lead in the rd minute with a towering header before Griezmann added to their advantage with a penalty in the th minute. Getafe pulled one back three minutes from fulltime with Oscar Rodriguez's deflected shot from inside the box, before Mayoral equalised again from the penalty spot with his second of the night. \"Oh my God. The first minutes were calm, then it was a crazy game. A fair draw, a lot of emotions and we'll have to analyse it afterwards,\" said Mayoral, who took his LaLiga tally to goals this season. \"I'm happy, things are going well for me. I'm very fit and I've had a great season.\"",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Sports development company A, which was formed to assist with creating soccer's European Super League, proposed a new competition on Thursday with men's and women's teams playing midweek matches in a league system across Europe. During a presentation aired on YouTube, A CEO Bernd Reichart declined to name any clubs that could become part of the new league but said fans would be able to watch matches free of charge on a fancentric streaming platform. The proposal was announced soon after the said soccer ruling bodies UEFA and FIFA had contravened EU law by preventing the formation of a Super League which was unveiled in . \"This vision is based on extensive consultation with a wide range of football stakeholders across Europe and built on our core principles including participation based on sporting merit and no permanent members,\" A said in a statement. \"Participating clubs stay in their domestic leagues which remain the foundation of European football. \"Now that clubs can determine their own future at European level, we look forward to further engagement with a broad set of football stakeholders to achieve the objective of all great sporting competitions.\" The Super League competition would threaten UEFA's major club competitions, including its flagship Champions League. The proposed format for the men's competition includes teams in three leagues Star, Gold and Blue. The Star and Gold Leagues will have clubs each while the Blue League has clubs. Teams will play home and away in groups of eight, which would mean a minimum of matches a year. There will be annual promotion and relegation between leagues while teams can qualify for the Blue League based on domestic league performance. The women's competition would have two leagues of clubs each. Reichart said that clubs would be invited to shape the new competition. \"Our proposal has to be convincing and we invite clubs to shape and to help shape this proposal,\" he said. \"We want to reach as many clubs as possible to shape and to contribute. There are clubs who are really interested in our proposal and to learn more and to contribute.\" Outlining plans to show the matches free of charge, Reichart said viewing Champions League matches had become prohibitively expensive. \"Our proposals are a fancentric platform that brings together clubs and fans like never before,\" he said. \"Investors will back us on the development and the launch of the platform and this is why we are reaching out to safeguard this vision that we share. \"This is a unique opportunity to rethink how football is presented to the fans.\" The previous attempt to launch a new league was met with fierce resistance and all six of the English Premier League clubs involved subsequently pulled out. Reichart said the new proposals were not a threat to national leagues and that they were designed to unite clubs and avoid confrontation. \"It's open, it's meritocratic, it's accessible,\" he said. \"The right to dream is alive as it probably has never been alive before. So solidarity, openness, and meritocracy are cornerstones of our proposal.\" Reichart said the new league would allow more clubs to compete in Europe. \"At the moment clubs can perform extremely well at the European level, yet still not be in the same competition the subsequent year,\" he said. \"This is viewed as unfair and not consistent with the concept of sporting merit.\"",

Diego Simeone's side are level with fourthplaced Barcelona on points and seven behind leaders Real Madrid. Atletico took the lead seconds after halftime when substitute Llorente's cross was blocked but he capitalised on Sergio Ramos's rebound to fire home from close range. \"I was lucky enough to get a great pass and score to get the three points,\" Llorente told DAZN. \"We had to push hard, make more effort than usual. We are a very united team and when it gets tough the squad pulls together.\" Llorente came close to adding a second with a header that hit the top of the net and a shot saved by Sevilla keeper Marko Dmitrovic. As in their last match, Atletico were reduced to men in the th minute when defender Caglar Soyuncu, who had only been on the pitch for four minutes, was shown a red card for a tackle on Lucas Ocampos. \"The red card can happen, it's football. The important thing is that the team made a great effort and didn't notice the extra player they had. The effort is to be admired,\" said Atletico midfielder Rodrigo De Paul. \"It's always important that we don't concede goals, it was a very important game for us. I'm very happy.\" Atletico next play secondplaced Girona.",

Forest are th in the standings with three wins this season, on points from matches, five points above the relegation zone. They have earned just one point from their last six games, which also included a defeat by Fulham, where Forest fans sang Cooper's name as a show of support. \"Steve Cooper has today been relieved of his duties as head coach of Nottingham Forest, following a spell of over two years in charge\", the club said in a statement. Former Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham manager Nuno Espirito Santo is in the frame to succeed Cooper, according to British media reports. \"Everyone at Nottingham Forest would like to thank Steve for his superb contribution to our football club,\" owner Evangelos Marinakis said. \"His achievement in guiding Forest back to the Premier League will undoubtedly remain an iconic moment in the club's history.\" Cooper is the second Premier League manager to lose his job this season, after newlypromoted Sheffield United manager Paul Heckingbottom earlier this month. Cooper joined Forest in September on a twoyear deal when they were the bottom side in the Championship. He led them to promotion by the following May, winning the playoffs after finishing fourth. His contract was extended to in October . Forest, who broke the record for most transfers by a Premier League club in the closeseason window, had a rocky start to their first topflight campaign since . They survived a relegation scare after losing four matches straight in April with wins over Arsenal and Southampton in May and finished th, four points above the bottom three. Forest will host Bournemouth in the league on Saturday.",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Mauricio Pochettino endured several nearmisses with Tottenham Hotspur and left without winning any silverware so Chelsea's League Cup quarterfinal at home to Newcastle United will not be taken lightly by the Argentine. Pochettino's main priority might be to revive Chelsea's Premier League fortunes and return the club to the Champions League arena, but he needs no reminding that he is still without any honours in English football. The last time Chelsea won the League Cup was in when they beat Pochettino's Tottenham. Pochettino also took Spurs close to winning the Premier League, to the Champions League final and backtoback FA Cup semifinals. \"Of course, I want to win a trophy here in England. I want to lift a trophy now in this competition because it is important,\" Pochettino told reporters when asked whether the League Cup had become more important this season given Chelsea's midtable position in the Premier League. \"It means a lot because we want to deliver the job for our club. Delivering a trophy, the most important thing is to win. It's difficult to measure, it is a priority. It's in our mind, our objective, we need to be ready tomorrow to be closer to winning a title. My desire is to win.\" Pochettino's first season at Stamford Bridge has been a difficult one so far as he tries to find the right formula for an expensivelyassembled squad, although they earned a muchneeded win against bottom club Sheffield United at the weekend. While he won the French league title and French Cup during a spell at Paris St Germain, Pochettino's CV still looks lightweight, although he is not losing sleep over it. \"You need to be in the right club, in the right moment with all of the elements to win,\" he said. \"To be an elite manager, it's not necessary to win titles, many elite managers still didn't win or are going to win. \"It's important to analyse every single project and say you can progress or not or deliver the job everyone expects. The League Cup is important for the club because it's going to be a boost in energy and I really believe in the project.\" Newcastle will also be desperate to reach the League Cup final again after losing to Manchester United last season denying them a first major trophy for years. \"For Newcastle it is also an important competition but from the beginning of the season it has been one of our objectives,\" Pochettino said. \"We face a very good team and will be tough.",

After their seventh win in the last eight league games, Inter top the standings on points from games and have stretched their lead over secondplaced Juventus , who missed the chance to go top when they were held to a at Genoa on Friday. It was Inter's first victory at the Rome side's home in Serie A since October . \"As a coach it feels good to win a match like that. We covered the pitch well, conceding only one chance to Nicolo Rovella. We were a team in difficult moments,\" coach Simone Inzaghi told a press conference. \"We have to continue in this way, playing as a team. The boys have to keep challenging me every training session because we play so much.\" Lazio started on the front foot, dominating possession and aggressively fending off Inter's attempts. However, the visitors were gifted the opener when Lazio defender Adam Marusic gave away the ball as he tried to pass it backwards and Martinez latched on to it to dribble past keeper Ivan Provedel and score from close range in the th minute. The Argentine forward netted his th league goal of the season, six more than Sassuolo's Domenico Berardi who is second on the scorers' list. Lazio pushed for an equaliser after the break and Rovella came close to finding the net from inside the box but was denied by goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Thuram doubled the advantage for Inter in the th minute with a low shot inside the far post after collecting a precise pass into the box from Nicolo Barella. The hosts finished down to men after defender Manuel Lazzari was shown a straight red card four minutes before the end for a remark he made to the referee after Lazio were refused a free kick. Inter's Sommer, who has now gone games without conceding, is the first goalkeeper to collect at least clean sheets in his first Serie A matches in the threepoint era since . No team has kept more clean sheets than Inter this season in the big five European leagues. Lazio, who had been unbeaten at their own ground this season since their August defeat to Genoa , are th in the table with points.",

Arteta called it their \"worst game of the season\" after Arsenal on an early lead and lost their second straight game, ending the year fourth after being top of the table at Christmas. \"Painful and sad day, that's how I would sum it up... we simply weren't good enough,\" he told reporters. \"We could not control the direct play. It was so easy for Fulham to win that first, second ball and have opportunity to run, and we conceded two goals that way. \"What happened today cannot happen again. Because if you do that you will never have the chance to be where we want to be.\" The North London side have points after matches, two behind leaders Liverpool who play their game in hand on Monday against Newcastle United. \"It could have been a beautiful way to end the year and finish top of the league, but these are the margins,\" Arteta added. The Spaniard said the team needed to focus on improving going forward. \"We want to win games,\" he said. \"We have a chance to be the best in the best in the league with these players. So, they are really good and we are going to continue to work with them.\" Arsenal resume their league campaign on Jan. against Crystal Palace.",

Littler's remarkable run to the final has also seen the teenager selected to take part in the Premier League, the Professional Darts Corporation PDC announced on Thursday. The contest at London's Alexandra Palace, with Littler bidding to become darts' youngest world champion, was viewed by a total of more than . million making it the most watched darts event ever on Sky. The previous peak record for a final of . million was set in January when Gary Anderson beat times world champion Phil Taylor. A of . million had already watched Littler's semifinal thrashing of champion Rob Cross on Tuesday. Humphries, who lived up to his \"Cool Hand Luke\" nickname, took the PDC World Championship with a victory after reeling off five successive sets. The world number one paid tribute to his young opponent afterwards. \"He's created a massive global following from so many incredible celebrities which is massive and great for our sport,\" Humphries, , told Sky. \"He well and truly could dominate the sport, that's for sure.\" Littler will become the youngestever player to take part in the Premier League and Humphries will also make his debut in the competition having risen to number one in the world rankings. \"Newlycrowned world champion Luke Humphries and teenage sensation Luke Littler will headline the BetMGM Premier League Darts lineup, with reigning champion Michael van Gerwen also starring in the eightplayer field for the forthcoming season,\" the PDC said. The roadshow tournament begins in Cardiff on Feb. and goes to other venues across the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands before the top four players in the league progress to the playoffs in London. Humphries, who took home a , pounds , winner's prize, recognised the raucous crowd had wanted the teenager to win but said he had to \"spoil the party\". He suggested also that Littler could change his nickname from 'The Nuke' to 'Relentless', so consistent and unfazed was his play. \"He made everything go his way. He showed such great maturity on young shoulders. If you are doing those sort of things at , it's mindless to think where he could be in five years' time. \"He will be world champion one day, there is no doubt in my mind. I just thought to myself its important that I get one in early before he does dominate us all and it becomes a much harder task to beat him.\" Littler told a press conference he had enjoyed every minute of the competition but was also looking forward to going home and \"getting back to reality\".",

Juve finished the year in second place with points from games behind Inter, who on Friday. Jose Mourinho's Roma are seventh with points. \"It was a good game, because playing against Roma is never easy, especially when Mourinho is on the opposition bench,\" Juve manager Massimiliano Allegri told DAZN. \"At this moment, I think we are in good shape physically, the last three days of training were good too and we had some impressive passing moves today. \"We gave the ball away a bit too often and need to work on that, but above all on the diagonal passes and how to play out from the back.\" Roma displayed their attacking intent early as Bryan Cristante's volley was deflected on to the post. Roma, who have staged several late comebacks to pick up points this season, struggled to create chances after going behind. The hosts went close to extending their lead but Weston McKennie missed a clear chance from pointblank range as keeper Rui Patricio saved with his feet. Federico Chiesa thought he had wrapped up the win after receiving a deflected ball inside the box and turning it into the net but he was flagged offside. \"We talked about this before the game and we created really more than anyone expected against a defensive wall in Turin,\" Mourinho told DAZN. \"I am very happy with the way we approached the game strategically, very happy with the character shown by my team, but its about points and we didnt get the result.\" Roma are five points behind Fiorentina in fourth and in a fight to qualify for the Champions League. \"If we get there, it would be absolutely fantastic, considering our conditions and limitations. If you do not dream, you will never get there,\" Mourinho said. Roma host Cremonese in the Coppa Italia round of on Jan. . Juve entertain Salernitana in the same competition the next day.",

Brailsford, INEOS's director of sport who has been named a director of United since the Ratcliffe deal was done, sat in the director's box for Tuesday's muchneeded victory, signalling a fresh start that manager Erik ten Hag said he welcomes. \"We are looking forward, I think it's positive for the club that they are in the stepping in,\" Ten Hag told reporters. \"They have a lot of experience in sport on the highest level, F, the cycling team INEOS Grenadiers, other football clubs, so it can only help and support us to get our targets. \"So we are looking forward. They want to work with us and we want to work with them.\" Tuesday's encounter was truly a game of two halves as fans at Old Trafford booed United off the pitch at halftime. A remarkable turnaround saw Alejandro Garnacho net a brace and Rasmus Hojlund break a Premier League scoring drought of , minutes with the winner in the nd minute. The team were serenaded with delighted singing and a standing ovation at the final whistle. \"So we said keep going and believe it, in ourselves,\" Ten Hag said. \"And I said that is what I demand from the team, I said it before the game, I said it during halftime, keep believing and we will win this game.\" Hojlund, who signed for United from Italian side Atalanta in August, scored five goals in four Champions League games but his inability to connect in the Premier League had raised some eyebrows. \"Yes, of course,\" Ten Hag said, on keeping Hojlund's confidence up. \"I had several talks with him and every time I pointed out 'Hey, you scored for Denmark, a lot. You scored in the Champions League. So this demonstrated ability. So, you can do it. So believe in it, and it will come'. \"I'm sure now the first goal is in he will net more. \"When strikers don't score, it's a problem, but he has a strong character, he is so resilient, he is so determined, he has a big personality and I think that is what a striker needs.\" United climbed two spots up to sixth in the standings on points with the victory. Ratcliffe will take a stake in United, in a deal announced on Christmas Eve, and pledged to invest million in the club to try to revive their fortunes. The deal is subject to a regulatory signoff.",

The victory moved thplaced Wolves to points from matches while Everton suffered their third defeat in a row to sit one point above the relegation zone in th. Wolves took the lead in the th minute when Cunha's cross into the box found Dawson, whose attempt was blocked by Everton keeper Jordan Pickford. A goalmouth scramble ensued before Kilman slotted home and he celebrated his first goal of the season by holding up the jersey of team mate Mario Lemina, who missed the game following the death of his father. \"That game was for Lemina. He has been brilliant and it's really tough what he's going through. He deserved it,\" Kilman said. \"I'm happy to score of course, but the main thing is the win and the clean sheet. We have a long way to go and we can still improve so we just need to keep going.\" Wolves doubled their lead early in the second half when Pablo Sarabia's defencesplitting diagonal pass found Hwang Heechan darting into the box and the South Korea international set up Cunha with a cross for a closerange finish. Cunha, who has scored six goals league goals this season, then turned provider as he set up Dawson for the third on the hourmark. Wolves found the net twice more, but both Hwang and Pedro Neto had their efforts chalked off for offside. Everton failed to have a single shot on target, their best chance coming in the second half when Dwight McNeil's longranger hit the woodwork. Everton, who started December with a fourmatch win streak, ended an exhausting month, in which they also exited the League Cup, with three straight league losses. \"They have turned into a good side and have worked hard to become one, especially at home. We have asked a lot of the players. The fixture list is unkind,\" Everton boss Sean Dyche said. \"We have just come off the back of a run of games with injuries. We lacked that bit of fizz and energy to take the game on. We fell short with the physicality of the game. \"They played really well and exposed moments when we looked jaded. We've done it to others ourselves and they did it to us today.\"",

After that, no, I haven't made up my mind yet. \"But in any case, with the agreement I made with the chairman Nasser AlKhelaifi this summer, it doesn't matter what I decide. \"We managed to protect all parties and preserve the club's serenity for the challenges ahead, which remains the most important thing.

Chelsea, who were th ahead of the Boxing Day fixtures, were already without Raheem Sterling and Cole Palmer two of their top three scorers for the London derby on Wednesday due to suspension. Although Fernandez is recovering from a hernia, Caicedo is ill and nine players are injured, leaving Pochettino without players for the final home game of the year. Noni Madueke and Romeo Lavia are available after they returned from injury in Chelsea's loss to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday. \"No, Enzo no. But Mo Caicedo, hopefully yes. Today he was better, yesterday Saturday he was a possibility but it's a high fever. I hope he can train a little bit and be ready for Palace,\" Pochettino told reporters. \"With Lesley Ugochukwu, we will assess him tomorrow, but I think he felt his hamstring again. I said in the press conference it is important how we reintroduce players, but we were forced because of the problem with Moises to play Lesley.\" Madueke and Mykhailo Mudryk are expected to start and Christopher Nkunku could make his full debut against Palace. Chelsea have received a leaguehigh yellow cards but when questioned about the club's disciplinary record, Pochettino defended his young squad. \"It's representative of the fact that we play for Chelsea, we are a big club and you feel the pressure,\" he said. \"When you are frustrated and lack a bit of experience, it's somewhere we can improve,. It's Palmer's first season in the Premier League and it is normal. He is playing for Chelsea. Of course, it's frustrating. \"But the players care, the players want to win. It's not about a lack of discipline, it's about having the ability to read the situation of the game.\"",

      "article_body": "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, Dec Reuters From league champions to European champions and now world champions, Manchester City added a fifth trophy in to their bulging collection when they beat Fluminense in Friday's Club World Cup final to cap their remarkable year. City are the first English club to simultaneously hold the Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup crowns which delighted manager Pep Guardiola hailed as an \"outstanding achievement\". \"I am so proud of this Club. What we have done is an outstanding achievement,\" Guardiola said. \"To win this trophy is to be the best team in the world. As a manager it is what I am most proud of, that we are always there. No matter how much we win, no matter what trophies we lift, we are there again to fight for the next one.\" Julian Alvarez netted a brace and City never let their Brazilian opponents find their groove. What appeared to be a serious knee injury to Rodri was the one damper on an otherwise festive night for City, whose players exchanged huge hugs on the pitch after the victory. City's season was already outstanding when they completed the treble by beating Inter Milan in the Champions League final in June, but they have since added two trophies in the Super Cup and Club World Cup. \"To win the treble was truly special, but to win two more trophies and now hold these five major titles shows the unique mentality of this team, of the club and its fans,\" Guardiola said. \"It is something no other English team has ever achieved and we will always remember this incredible time we spent together.\" Guardiola is the first manager to win the Club World Cup with three teams, guiding Barcelona to victory in and , and Bayern Munich in . City players will have a \"World Champions \" badge embroidered on their shirts for their next Premier League match on Wednesday at Everton, the club said in a release. A banner has already been raised at Etihad Stadium. \"We've shown over the past months we are the best team in the world,\" City captain Kyle Walker said. \"Our results prove that and the consistency we have managed has been amazing.\" City now turn their attentions back to the Premier League, where they have been anything but consistent. Guardiola's team are fourth in the table with only one win in their last five games. A serious injury to Rodri would be a big blow for City, who are already without leagueleading scorer Erling Haaland due to a nagging foot injury.",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Former Manchester United players Paul Scholes and Gary Neville expressed their disappointment at their old club's performance after Erik Ten Hag's side fell to a Premier League defeat to West Ham United on Saturday. West Ham's Jarrod Bowen and Mohammed Kudus scored secondhalf goals at the London Stadium to condemn United to their th defeat in all competitions their most losses at Christmas since , when they were relegated from the topflight. United, eighth in the standings and eight points off the top four, have struggled in front of goal, failing to score in four straight games in all competitions for the first time since the season. They have just league goals in as many matches, with only bottomclub Sheffield United having scored fewer. In their league games, United have failed to score in seven. \"There is no threat to the team. This is a very patched up team you have to say,\" former midfielder Scholes told TNT Sports. \"You spend a lot of money on players, expecting a lot more from them. Not happening for Marcus Rashford either. Easiest thing to coach in football is defending, hardest thing is to teach them to how to score goals. \"That has to come from the players. It is seriously lacking. It's getting embarrassing, creativity is the big problem.\" Exdefender Neville slammed United's inconsistency, telling Sky Sports \"It doesn't surprise me at all. What we're seeing from this team, under any manager in the last seven or eight years, is pretty much the same. \"You can't trust them, they will let you down. They give you a glimmer of hope and then they go and lose a game they shouldn't lose. \"We're watching an inconsistent bunch. Inconsistency is a really bad trait, in all walks of life.\" United next host thirdplaced Aston Villa in a league clash on Tuesday.",

      "article_body": "MANCHESTER, England, Dec Reuters British members of parliament are calling on the Premier League and other governing bodies to reduce the volume of gambling adverts in stadiums, citing a study that found nearly , visible gambling messages during six league matches. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee report on gambling regulation released on Thursday encourages the reduction to minimize children's exposure to gambling advertising. It concluded the government should take a more precautionary approach to advertising than what was proposed in the gambling White Paper policy document. \"While gambling regulation should not overly impinge on the freedom to enjoy what is a problemfree pastime for the majority, more should be done to shield both children and people who have experienced problem gambling from what often seems like a bombardment of advertising branding at football and other sporting events,\" committee chair Caroline Dinenage said. The Gosport MP said the government needs to go further than the proposals in the White Paper published earlier this year and \"work with sports governing bodies on cutting the sheer volume of betting adverts people are being exposed to\". A recent study found that frontofshirt gambling branding made up of all gambling branding that was visible during broadcast matches surveyed. The committee said while they welcome the decrease in gambling sponsorship on Premier League players' shirts, it does not reduce the volume of adverts visible during a game. The report backed many of the provisions in the gambling White Paper, including developing a system of financial risk checks by gambling operators on customer accounts that lose a certain amount of money within a certain timeframe. The committee was also in favour of the government's plan to implement extra online protections for young adults through a lower stake limit and thresholds for triggering financial risk checks. The British government recently announced they were considering a statutory levy paid by gambling operators to fund gambling addiction research, prevent and treatment, which the report supported.",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Following is reaction to Thursday's European Court of Justice ruling that UEFA and FIFA contravened EU law when they prevented the formation of a Super League. \"At Real Madrid we welcome with enormous satisfaction the decision adopted by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which is responsible for guaranteeing our principles, values and freedoms. \"In the coming days we will carefully study the scope of this resolution, but I do anticipate two conclusions of great historical significance. \"Firstly, that European club football is not and will never again be a monopoly. And secondly, that from today the clubs will be the masters of their destiny. \"In short, today the Europe of freedoms has triumphed again and today football and its fans have also triumphed.\" \"This ruling does not signify an endorsement or validation of the socalled 'super league' it rather underscores a historical shortfall within UEFA's preauthorisation framework, a technical aspect that has already been acknowledged and addressed in June . \"UEFA is confident in the robustness of its new rules, and specifically that they comply with all relevant European laws and regulations.\" \"FIFA will now analyse the decision in coordination with UEFA, the other confederations and the member associations before commenting further. \"In line with its Statutes, FIFA firmly believes in the specific nature of sport, including the pyramid structure which is underpinned by sporting merit and the principles of competitive balance and financial solidarity.\" \"With the greatest respect for the European Court of Justice, todays judgement does not change anything, really. \"Historically, we have been organising the best competitions in the world and this will also be the case in the future.\" \"We strongly support the protection of employment markets, domestic leagues, sporting merit and a pyramid model. \"We reject any plans to unilaterally undermine the social and cultural fabric of European football and threaten employment opportunities for players such as the proposal for a European Super League. \"More than ever, collective decisions must prioritise player protection, fair participation and secure employment not erode them. We will continue this path with UEFA and the social partners.\" BERND REICHART, CEO OF A SPORTS MANAGEMENT the company formed to help set up the European Super League \"We have won the right to compete. The UEFAmonopoly is over. Football is free. Clubs are now free from the threat of sanction and free to determine their own futures.\" on overcoming laws and securing approvals \"We are not the breakaway league, we are completely compatible with the calendar of domestic leagues. We are connected to domestic leagues. \"We are an open, meritocratic competition who will be nurtured with the access from domestic leagues and whatever it takes to get approval from wherever.\" \"The ruling does not endorse the socalled 'European Super League' and the Premier League continues to reject any such concept.\" \"Football is a social contract not a legal contract. \"All the recognised stakeholders... stand more united than ever against the attempts by a few individuals pursuing personal agendas to undermine the very foundations and basic principles of European football.\" \"We remain fully committed to participation in UEFA competitions, and to positive cooperation with UEFA, the Premier League, and fellow clubs through the ECA on the continued development of the European game.\" \"We remain committed to the values of European football, and we will continue to work with fellow clubs through the ECA and participate in UEFA.\" \"We firmly believe that, by working with the Premier League, The FA, other European clubs through our strong relationship with the ECA, and with UEFA and FIFA, we can, together, continue to develop the European game for the benefit of everyone.\" \"Paris SaintGermain rejects wholly and completely any socalled Super League project, which has been the case since day one and will always remain the case,\" PSG president Nasser AlKhelaifi said. \"As a proud European institution, PSG supports the principles of the European Sports Model... and working with all recognised stakeholders of European football most importantly for the fans and players.\" \"The attempt to create a breakaway competition was a defining moment in English football and was universally condemned by fans, clubs and the Government. \"We took decisive action at the time by triggering the fanled review of football governance, which called for the creation of a new independent regulator for English football. \"We will shortly be bringing forward legislation that makes this a reality, and will stop clubs from joining any similar breakaway competitions in the future.\" \"As one of the clubs driving the Super League project, Barcelona feels that the sentence paves the way for a new elite level football competition in Europe by opposing the monopoly over the football world and wishes to initiate new discussions as to the path that European competitions should take in the future.\" \"They are already celebrating as I warned they would. They have always been able to organise competitions outside the UEFA and FIFA environment, and that cannot be prohibited, the issue is their conditions to be within the organization of UEFA and FIFA. \"The CJEU says that FIFA and UEFA's competition admission rules are transparent, but not that they should admit the Super League. On the contrary, it points out that the criteria for the admission of competitions must be transparent, objective and nondiscriminatory. \"Principles that are precisely incompatible with the Super League.\" \"There is no place for an illconceived breakaway super league,\" FSA chief executive Kevin Miles said. \"Supporters, players and clubs have already made clear they don't want a stitchedup competition we all want to see the trigger pulled on the walking dead monstrosity that is the European Zombie League. \"While the corpse might continue to twitch in the European courts, no English side will be joining. The incoming independent regulator will block any club from competing in domestic competition if they join a breakaway super league.\" \"The ECJ's ruling that UEFA and FIFA have restricted competition by effectively banning the ESL will embolden the likes of Florentino Perez and Joan Laporta to push on with the Super League plan. \"Unwilling to sacrifice their own dominant market positions domestically to create a more competitive product, which in turn would drive higher media rights fees, the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona will see the ECJ ruling as an opportunity to enrich themselves and further imbalance the soccer ecosystem and create a new commercial reality for the sport.\" \"Lega Serie A reiterates the centrality of the national Championship and its fans and hopes that the subsequent developments will see a full involvement of the Leagues and Clubs.\"",

The France international played in Tuesday's League Cup win over Newcastle United after four months out a with knee injury. But Pochettino told reporters the yearold, who cost Chelsea million pounds in the close season, needs more time. \"Everyone was excited because we want to see him involved in the game. We know his quality and capacity to help the team in a very good way,\" the manager said. \"We need to be patient and give time to give him the capacity to find his best form. It is too early to see him start the game, but maybe in the next few games we are going to consider him to start.\" Pochettino advocated a similar approach for the recovery of defender Reece James who recently underwent hamstring surgery. \"We hope it will be several weeks, but we don't know for sure,\" he said about James' recovery timeline. \"The most important thing is to see him again here with us and assess him day by day.\" Romeo Lavia, Noni Madueke and Lesley Ugochukwu have returned to full training as thplaced Chelsea seek to end a threematch away game losing streak against thplaced Wolves. The manager also backed Chelsea's statement committing to UEFA competitions following Thursday's European Court of Justice ruling that UEFA and FIFA contravened EU law when they prevented the formation of a Super League. \"It is difficult for me to see how that is going to happen... there are too many question marks.\" Pochettino said about the ESL. \"I am focused instead on the Premier League.\" Chelsea have the opportunity to end December on a high note by beating Wolves, Crystal Palace and Luton Town over the next seven days. \"It is going to be massive for us in terms of the points we can win from these games, but for now I only think about Wolves,\" Pochettino said.",

Kompany said he also welcomed the appointment of Sam Allison for the Sheffield United versus Luton Town match on Dec. . Allison will be the first Black referee to be selected for a Premier League match since Uriah Rennie in . \"What you have to look at is not necessarily what it means for the person themselves. Behind it there are a lot of people who don't think it is possible, who don't think they can achieve it,\" Kompany said. \"By seeing those examples they will say 'I could be the next one, maybe I could do something positive'\".",

The referee was then kicked while laying on the pitch, prompting the Turkish Football Federation TFF to impose a on Koca, who was arrested the day after the match. As matches resumed on Tuesday, kids wearing shirts that read \"respect\" presented flowers to the referees during the prematch ceremony ahead of the BasaksehirSivasspor game, footage showed. \"As a lover of football, I am not against the decision they took to suspend league games. If I were a referee, I would not attend any matches until the end of the league,\" said Basaksehir fan Talha Aydin, . Birol Yolcu, another Basaksehir fan, said he agreed with the decision to suspend the matches, but that he welcomed that they had now resumed. \"I am thankful that at least our referees made the right decision and decided to continue attending the games. This is a very radical decision,\" Yolcu, , said. \"We are talking about a referee Meler, who is accredited by FIFA. This is a very important criteria. Therefore, I think this the decision to suspend the games was correct,\" he said. Referees in Turkey are often criticised by club managers and presidents for their rulings, especially due to discontent with the video assistant referee VAR system, but they have rarely been the target of violent attacks. The shocking attack has thrust the entire culture of Turkish football into the , with the escalating issues of political influence and disrespect for officials at the heart of the debate.",

The more goals you have, the more you're used to missing chances and the more you just understand what you have to do keep going and if necessary keep improving, using the situations better, and that's what Mo did.\" Salah, who will join up with Egypt for their African Cup of Nations campaign this month, is now jointtop goalscorer in the league with Manchester City's Erling Haaland on . \"It's not superstitious because I play with many boots. But when I feel it's going to play with my head, okay, out, change the boots,\" Salah said. Liverpool thoroughly dominated against Newcastle on a wild and raindrenched evening at Anfield, with shots to the visitors' five, and shots on target. \"I didn't have to look at the stats, because I saw it. It was really special,\" Klopp said. \"It was partly keeper Martin Dubravka. \"We didn't stop, that's the most important thing.\" A couple of weeks after calling out the Anfield crowd for two uncharacteristically quiet games, the German had nothing but praise for the fans who braved the blustery conditions on Monday. \"Tonight the atmosphere was absolutely exceptional in how we all took together, these missed chances,\" Klopp said. \"It was not like 'Oh my god, what are they doing' and I would understand that in moments, but everybody was just really on fire and we go again, we go again, we go again and we did. \"So, super game from start to finish, super high intensity.\" There was a moment of panic for the coach when he lost his wedding ring on the pitch after fulltime while clapping along with the fans. He spent several moments retracing his steps before spotting the ring and then kissing it with a grin for a television camera. \"That would have been really awful,\" said a relieved Klopp. \"I lost it in the sea once and needed a professional diver.

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Tottenham Hotspur brought resurgent Bournemouth down to earth with a flattering Premier League victory thanks to goals by Pape Matar Sarr, Son Heungmin and Richarlison on Sunday. Bournemouth were unbeaten in seven league games with six wins in that sequence and they will wonder how that run was not extended as they dominated in rainhit north London. Sarr gave Tottenham an early lead before he went off injured while captain Son and Richarlison scored late on after the home side had ridden their luck against a slick visiting side. Alex Scott replied for Bournemouth in the th minute but it was scant consolation for Andoni Iraola's side whose goal attempts was double the number of Tottenham. Unconvincing as it was, Tottenham's win sent them into the New Year in the thick of the battle for a topfour finish. They are in fifth place with points from games, one behind fourthplaced Arsenal and only three adrift of leaders Liverpool who have played a game less. \"Every week is a battle and we had to battle today. At the same time I thought we played some decent stuff as well,\" Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said. \"We're trying to build something. I'm at pains to keep repeating myself but we're trying to build a team that plays a bit differently and has some resilience and you can only gain that through tough times.\" Postecoglou's side, still missing a host of firstteam players and the suspended Dejan Kulusevski, started brightly and pressed Bournemouth into early errors with keeper Neto's casual ball out being closed down by Rodrigo Bentancur with the ball breaking to Sarr who dispatched a low shot into the net. Bournemouth quickly settled though and Marcus Tavernier's free kick flew narrowly wide while inform striker Dominic Solanke saw an effort deflect off Tottenham's Ben Davies and on to the top of the crossbar shortly before halftime. Patchedup Tottenham had suffered yet another injury blow before that when Sarr limped off looking distraught. Bournemouth continued to control proceedings in the second half with Solanke, who had nine goal attempts, forcing saves from Tottenham keeper Guglielmo Vicario. The visitors were left to rue their missed chances though on the th minute as Son got clear on the left of the area and thumped a leftfooted shot beyond Neto. Richarlison wrapped it up with a simple finish from Brennan Johnson's delivery the Brazilian's fifth goal in his last five Premier League appearances. Tottenham played the final stages with men after substitute Alejo Veliz went off injured and Bournemouth's late rally caused jitters in the home ranks as Scott touched home and then had another goal ruled out for offside.",

      "article_body": "NOTTINGHAM, England, Dec Reuters Dominic Solanke scored a hattrick as Bournemouth ruined the managerial debut of Nuno Espirito Santo at man Nottingham Forest with a pulsating lastgasp Premier League victory on Saturday. Solanke completed his treble four minutes into stoppagetime to deny Forest a point after Chris Wood looked to have earned the home side a draw with his fourth goal of the season following Anthony Elangas opener. Forest stayed in th place with points from games, two points above the relegation zone, while Bournemouth moved up to th with points from matches. \"To score that winner late on just makes it so much better,\" Solanke said. \"I love all goals but maybe the third one was my favourite. I had a meeting yesterday about scoring headers and I've scored two today. So happy to get the win as well.\" The home side will feel aggrieved after two controversial decisions in the first half went against them the first a harsh yellow card that saw Wily Bony sent off on minutes. They also thought they should have had a penalty but Adam Smith's handball was adjudged to be just outside the area by the Video Assistant Referee. Nuno would have hoped for a positive result after replacing Steve Cooper at Forest this week, but it was never going to be a quick fix and the same defensive frailties that have dogged the side all season were on show again. The home side lost Boly midway through the first half when the centre back received a second yellow card following a tackle on Bournemouth's Adam Smith. Replays suggested it was Smith who was at fault, though, as he caught Boly in the followthrough, but as the Video Assistant Referee VAR cannot intervene on yellow cards, the decision stood. The hosts led when Wood robbed Alex Scott of possession and played in Elanga, who provided a composed low finish into the far corner. The lead lasted only four minutes, however, when Marcos Senesi's cross was headed in by Solanke and he added a second seven minutes. Wood equalised for Forest minutes from the end when his goalbound header was deflected into the net, but Bournemouth kept seeking a winner and it arrived deep into stoppagetime via the head of Solanke. \"When you go down to you have to fight and do things that's not in the gameplan,\" Wood told Sky Sports. \"We did well to get in the game, unfortunately conceded some goals. \"At you can't concede you have to be resilient. It's a hammer blow, it's tough to take.\"",

The yearold Argentine was helped off the pitch during the Premier League home win over Bournemouth on New Year's Eve. \"Unfortunately, it was a fairly significant injury,\" said Postecoglou. \"He had scans after the game and it's going to keep him out probably a couple months. \"Won't need surgery but some significant ligament damage, so disappointing for him because he's kind of worked hard to get an opportunity in the last couple of weeks.\" Tottenham's South Korea captain HeungMin Son and Senegal midfielder Pape Matar Sarr will be among the key players missing from Friday's FA Cup third round tie at home to Burnley due to international duty at the Asian Cup and Africa Cup of Nations respectively. Postecoglou did have some positive news with Dutch defender Micky van de Ven close to returning from the hamstring injury he suffered in their Premier League loss to Chelsea on Nov. . \"Micky has trained this week,\" the Australian said. \"I'm not sure about Friday's game, he might be involved in the squad. It is good to get him back but obviously he has missed a fair bit so we will have to be careful with him.\" While fifthplaced Spurs are in the thick of the crowded Premier League title fight, six points behind leaders Liverpool, the manager insisted the Premier League does not hold more importance than the FA Cup. \"I know what I feel. Every competition I am in, I want to win. I don't rank them or diminish any against others. Whether it's domestic or continental, everything is hard earned,\" he said. \"I have not sensed anything different with this competition. \"The club has history in this, many of the greatest memories Spurs supporters have will have been in the FA Cup.\" Tottenham have won the FA Cup eight times, but their most recent triumph was back in the . \"I'm similar to anyone who loves football. The FA Cup is a significant event. The FA Cup reaches every corner of the globe, it is a great competition with great tradition and I am looking forward to having a crack at it,\" Postecoglou said. \"At the start of every season every club has ambitions and dreams of winning silverware. More than anything else it is an opportunity for us to try and win a competition and for a club of our stature that should be the ambition every year.\"",

      "article_body": "GENOA, Italy, Dec Reuters Serie A leaders Inter Milan were held to a draw away to Genoa on Friday as Marko Arnautovic's first league goal for the club was cancelled out by a header from Radu Dragusin. Inter are top with points but the result gives secondplaced Juventus, on , an opportunity to close the gap as they host AS Roma on Saturday. Genoa are th with . Inter broke the deadlock after minutes when Austrian Arnautovic found himself in the right place to tap home a rebound off the post following Nicolo Barella's volley. He opened his account for the club in Serie A after being sidelined for several matches due to a hamstring injury following his in the close season. However, Genoa equalised in firsthalf stoppage time when Dragusin's powerful header from a corner eluded Yann Sommer despite the goalkeeper getting both hands on the ball. \"We knew the type of game that we were going into. Genoa are in great shape, both physically and mentally, it was a hardfought match,\" Inter manager Simone Inzaghi told DAZN. \"The second half probably would have been different without conceding at that moment in firsthalf added time. We wanted to win, we are not happy with the point, but we must continue and remember that every match holds dangers.\" The game was interrupted for about eight minutes just after the start with the release of several flares resulting in dense smoke that reduced visibility following heavy rainfall. As the smoke cleared Genoa showed little respect for injuryhit Inter, who were missing key players like Lautaro Martinez and Federico Dimarco, and came close to scoring several times. Having already managed to hold Juventus to a draw earlier in the month at Stadio Luigi Ferraris, Genoa were again driven forward by an enthusiastic home crowd. Inter started to gain momentum around the hour mark and Francesco Acerbi almost put them back in front with a header only for Josep Martinez to make a fine save. \"It was not easy to play on a heavy pitch that made it tough for both teams,\" Inzaghi added. \"We had a huge chance with Acerbi their goalkeeper made a great save and we tried to limit their counterattacks.\" The match then fizzled out with few clearcut chances and both sides appeared content to end the year with a draw. \"We must retain the solidity, the hunger and clearly try to bring more consistency,\" said Inzaghi. \"We know that were not even halfway through the season. It will be a long and tough road with difficulties that we must overcome.\" In Friday's other late game, Lazio recovered from a goal down to beat visiting Frosinone courtesy of Valentin Castellanos, Gustav Isaksen and Patric in a minute spell late in the match. Maurizio Sarri's side are eighth on points. Inter will start the New Year by hosting lowly Hellas Verona on Jan. , while Lazio visit Udinese the following day.",

Erik ten Hag's United are struggling in seventh place on points from games after their th defeat this term in all competitions. The last time they had more losses in a season by the turn of the year was way back in . \"The result is clear. It's disappointing,\" Ten Hag told the BBC. \"The loss was unnecessary. We lost it in the first half. We weren't energised enough or invested enough. \"In the second we were better. We know these results are below our standards.\" It was Forest's first league win over United since , and first at home in the Premier League era, to delight their newly appointed . \"This season in general has been one step forward and two steps back and it felt like that today,\" said United midfielder Christian Eriksen. \"Our aim was to get three points so it's definitely disappointing to come away with zero. \"Things will heal and get better. There's only one way forward and that's to work hard.\" The visitors were coming off a home win over Aston Villa on Boxing Day after going two goals down but inconsistency struck again on Saturday and they struggled in both attack and defence, sinking to another low in a calamitous season. Dominguez broke the deadlock in what had been a drab game after minutes with a shot from the centre of the box. Marcus Rashford equalised in the th when Alejandro Garnacho pounced on a poor clearance from goalkeeper Matt Turner and sent a precise pass across the edge of the yard box to Rashford who fired into the bottom right corner. United's celebrations were shortlived however as GibbsWhite curled a superb shot into the corner on the counterattack after Turner had made a great save at the other end. The victory means Forest, who won backtoback games for the first time this season, are th on points after matches, five points clear of the drop zone. The win was Forest's second under Nuno, who replaced fan favourite Steve Cooper on Dec. and guided them to a Boxing Day victory at Newcastle United last time out. \"We've had some good performances as a team and he Nuno just said thanks for trusting in the game plan. It makes you want to play for him even more,\" GibbsWhite told Sky Sports. United striker Rasmus Hojlund, whose first league goal got the win against Villa, was missing through illness and Rashford whose goal was United's first on the road in a league game since a win at Everton on Nov. struggled up front. United, who are out of Europe and the League Cup in what is proving to be a challenging season, spurned several lastgasp chances to equalise, including Eriksen's effort seconds before the final whistle that rolled just wide of the net.",

We have to get our heads up, rest, the Cup and the Super Cup are coming up and we don't have much time to think about it.\" Girona opened the scoring two minutes into the game with Valery Fernandez curling in a great shot from the edge of the box before Atletico levelled through Morata in the th minute. Girona's high pressing paid off as they stole the ball from Atletico's Koke before Savio scored at the second attempt to make it in the th minute. Dutch defender Daley Blind extended the hosts' lead in the th minute with a tapin before Morata pulled one back for Atletico with a fine solo run in the last minute of the first half. Morata got his third in the rd minute, firing home from inside the box to equalise again, but Martin sealed the win for Girona with a brilliant strike. \"I was lucky to score the goal. It's no coincidence, we've been doing a great job since we were in the second tier,\" said Martin. \"I'm happy to play the way I'm playing. European football is there for us, but we have to keep going.\" Girona and Atletico kick off their Spanish Cup campaigns on Saturday against Elche and Lugo respectively.",

      "article_body": "MANCHESTER, England, Dec Reuters Manchester City ended a run of three successive Premier League home draws with a comfortable victory over bottom club Sheffield United to move up to third spot and round off a memorable year on Saturday. Goals by Rodri and Julian Alvarez in each half barely did justice to City's dominance as they enjoyed possession in a routine win that at times resembled a training session. Phil Foden set up Rodri to open the scoring with a precise finish in the th minute and the England midfielder was instrumental in City's second goal just past the hour mark as his pass was tapped in by Alvarez. City, who had not won a league match at home since early November, never had to engage top gear as United defended deeply and with great discipline to avoid a heavy loss. While the points were welcome even more good news for City was the sight of key midfielder Kevin de Bruyne appearing on the bench, having been out since the opening game of the season. City move above Arsenal into third place with points from games, two points behind leaders Liverpool and Aston Villa. The Blades remain bottom on nine points. Pep Guardiola's City side have hit unprecedented heights this year, claiming a treble including a first Champions League crown and last week becoming FIFA Club World Cup champions. In truth a home victory over Sheffield United was tame by comparison, but after a wobble in form it seems City are back in the groove as they move into the second half of the campaign. \"We learned from the last home game against Crystal Palace,\" Rodri said of that draw. \"We had to keep focusing and Sheffield didn't have the intention to come to us so we had to keep the ball. Important for us this victory.\" De Bruyne was not needed in the end but the sight of the Belgium playmaker warming up on the touchline in the second half prompted one of the biggest cheers of the afternoon. City will also have Norwegian goal machine Erling Haaland back from injury soon to boost their bid for a record fourth successive Premier League title. For Sheffield United a long hard struggle against relegation is what they have to look forward to in as they are seven points behind thplaced Everton in the safety zone. But manager Chris Wilder remains upbeat. \"We are light in terms of Premier League experience but what we aren't light on is fight or character and that has delighted me since I walked through the door,\" Wilder, who returned to the club after Paul Heckingbottom was sacked earlier this month. \"I know there are plenty of teams who would have got done five or six with the vibe and the feel today. We try and take something from it.\"",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Amidst the euphoria of Manchester United's stunning comeback victory over Aston Villa on Tuesday, one figure sat calmly in the Old Trafford stands processing what had just occurred. A sizeable majority of supporters in the stadium might not even have recognised Dave Brailsford. But over the coming months he is likely to become a familiar figure. While INEOS founder Jim Ratcliffe's acquisition of the times English champions will not be officially signed off until early former kingpin of British cycling Brailsford will be scheming about what needs to change at a club that has been in steady decline since Alex Ferguson retired. Fans might well ask why Brailsford, the brains behind Britain becoming a cycling powerhouse and who made INEOS Grenadiers formerly Team Sky multiple Grand Tour champions, would be entrusted with one of the biggest challenges in soccer. After all, the yearold, who Ratcliffe made INEOS's Director of Sport, has no obvious background in the sport. Brailsford's \"marginal gains\" manta turned British cyclists into winning machines and while he took on a technical role with INEOSowned French Ligue club Nice in a bid to take on the Paris St Germain, the jury is still out on his impact. United fan Ratcliffe, whose purchase plus investment of million will give him control of football operations, has been tightlipped about who will do what in the new regime. But he has huge trust in Brailsford's attention to detail and scientific approach and will no doubt allow him the freedom he needs to reestablish a winning culture at the club. Newcastle United's highlyregarded sporting director Dan Ashworth is in no doubt about Brailsford's credentials. \"I've known Sir Dave for a number of years, working across various different sports and he is without doubt the best in world sport at creating highperformance culture and turning that into winning,\" Ashworth said after inviting him to speak to his Newcastle squad last season. Brailsford joined British Cycling in and became Performance Director in . A year later, at the Athens Olympics, two gold medals were delivered. But that was just a taste of things to come. In and , Britain topped the Olympic cycling medals tables with eight golds and Brailsford was instrumental in providing the environment for the likes of Chris Hoy, Bradley Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton to dominate on the track. When Brailsford headed up the newlyformed Team Sky professional road cycling tam in and vowed a Briton would win the Tour de France for the first time, many scoffed. But Wiggins won the sport's most prestigious race in before Chris Froome followed with four triumphs in the next five years as Team Sky became almost unbeatable. In all, Brailsford masterminded Grand Tour wins for the team, although their domination has waned in recent years. The question now is whether Brailsford can have a similar impact at United whose last Premier League title was in .",

      "article_body": "SALERNO, Italy Dec Reuters Luka Jovic came off the bench to score a th minute goal which saw AC Milan come away from bottom club Salernitana with a draw in Serie A on Friday. Salernitana have nine points and remain bottom of the table, while Milan remain in third place on points, four adrift of Juventus in second place who take on Frosinone on Saturday. \"It leaves you with regrets, like so many other times this season,\" Milan manager Stefano Pioli told DAZN. \"The hardest part was to make the breakthrough, which we did and controlled it well. The we made mistakes that we can't afford at this level. We were able to pull it back, but it wasn't the result we wanted.\" Milan opened the scoring in the th minute when a free kick found Rafael Leao in the box who played the ball back across the goal where it was headed home by Fikayo Timori. Salernitana equalised in the nd minute from a corner kick when Federico Fazio rose above Ruben LoftusCheek to power his header past Mike Maignan. Maignan had only just pulled off a great save from Antonio Candreva which led to the corner, but could do nothing to keep out Fazio's header and the sides went in level at the break. The home side took the lead in the rd minute, with Antonio Candreva taking the ball to the edge of the area out wide and with Maignan expecting a cross, the shot took him by surprise and beat him at the near post. \"We shouldn't have allowed Salernitana to take the lead and get back into the game. We still have a lot of work to do to become a great team,\" Pioli said. Salernitana came close to extending their lead just four minutes later but this time Maignan was there to tip over Pasquale Mazzocchi's shot from outside the area. Salernitana looked set to claim just their second win of the season but substitute Jovic's th minute goal rescued Milan from defeat. The Serbian striker had replaced Ismael Bennacer in the th minute, Bennacer making his first start of the season. Jovic forced keeper Benoit Costil into a doublesave from close range in the nd minute with first a header and then a shot from the rebound, but eight minutes later he scored his third goal of the season. Davide Calabria's cross was headed down by Olivier Giroud and Jovic let the ball bounce before hitting a halfvolley into the far corner to save Pioli's side from an embarrassing defeat. Fiorentina moved into fourth spot with their win away to Monza on Friday with Lucas Beltran the scorer, they are on points and move two points ahead of Bologna who host Atalanta on Saturday.",

In their first match since winning the Club World Cup, City climbed back into the league's top four thanks to secondhalf goals by Phil Foden, Julian Alvarez and Bernardo Silva. City moved above Tottenham Hotspur into fourth place with points from games, five behind leaders Liverpool, having played a game less. City's quest for an unprecedented fourth successive league title hit turbulence before Christmas with a defeat by thirdplaced Aston Villa and draws against Tottenham and Crystal Palace, but Guardiola was pleased with the mentality his players showed at Goodison Park. \"I remember on the plane coming back from Saudi Arabia, I listened to the players when they didn't know I was listening, and they started to talk about Everton,\" Guardiola said. \"I said 'wow, this is my team'. I have the feeling they still want to try. \"We play many games this season and people say we are not the same. We have lost one of the last excluding the Club World Cup. We don't talk enough about how good we are.\" The win against Everton came at a cost with defender John Stones being forced off due to an injury against his former club. \"It doesn't look good, but we will see. It's his ankle,\" Guardiola told Amazon Prime. The European champions, who also won the UEFA Super Cup this year, have missed the influence of injured Belgian playmaker Kevin De Bruyne while a foot problem has denied them the services of Norwegian goal machine Erling Haaland recently. \"He Haaland feels better, but he hasn't made one training session with us,\" he said. \"Hopefully, in January, he can come back with us. \"Kevin is close... we have to be careful. If you don't handle the timings good, you can get injured again.\" City next host promoted Sheffield United on Saturday.",

      "article_body": "HONG KONG, Dec Reuters Talking points from the week in Asian football Sergej MilinkovicSavic scored a hattrick as AlHilal maintained their point lead over Cristiano Ronaldo's AlNassr at the top of the Saudi Pro League with a thrashing of Abha on Friday. The former Lazio midfielder put his side in front in the th minute before Aleksandar Mitrovic scored from the penalty spot to double his side's lead seven minutes later, and Salem AlDawsari added the third minutes from time. MilinkovicSavic netted the fourth goal six minutes later while Mohamed Kanno and Ruben Neves were also on target, with the Serbian completing his hattrick five minutes into added time. AlNassr, who have played one game fewer than AlHilal, defeated AlIttifaq with Ronaldo scoring his side's third as the Riyadhbased outfit remained in second, while AlAhli are in third after their win over AlHazm. Wellington Phoenix opened up a threepoint gap at the top of the ALeague on Saturday with a late win over Western Sydney Wanderers. Injurytime goals from Kosta Barbarouses and Ben Old earned the New Zealandbased side a win that takes them clear of secondplaced Melbourne Victory, who were held to a draw by Melbourne City. \"The game's never done until it's over,\" said Wellington coach Giancarlo Italiano. \"I felt the game was very cat and mouse.\" Urawa Red Diamonds slipped to a loss against Egypt's AlAhly in the thirdplace playoff at the FIFA Club World Cup as coach Maciej Skorza left the Japanese outfit on a negative note. Jose Kante and Alex Scholz scored to pull Urawa level after Yasser Ibrahim and Percy Tau had given the African champions an early twogoal lead. Yoshio Koizumi's own goal put AlAhly back in front before Ali Maaloul's injury time effort completed the win. The game was the last in charge for Skorza, who led Urawa to the Asian Champions League title in May, less than six months after his appointment. Brisbane Roar announced the departure of Ross Aloisi from the role of head coach on Sunday, saying the former midfielder has left the club to take on an \"overseas opportunity\". Aloisi was appointed by Brisbane in May and led the club to the final of the Australia Cup, where they lost to Sydney FC in October. He had also overseen a solid start to the new ALeague campaign and leaves Brisbane in fifth place in the team competition, six points behind leaders Wellington Phoenix.",

The Dutchman has yet to speak to anyone from Ratcliffe's INEOS group as he has been busy during the Christmas period, during which United defeated Aston Villa on Tuesday and then face Forest away on Saturday. \"I look forward. They want to work with me, I want to work with them, we will have the conversations, the meetings,\" Ten Hag told a press conference referring to the INEOS group who will take over management of the club's soccer operations. \"I'm focused on the game so far, so I said no to talks. In this moment I don't want to have distractions. In the coming days, weeks, there will be time for us, then I'll know more. \"I think it's a good thing, it's very positive. We are looking really forward to work together. INEOS wants to work with me in this structure and I want to work with them.\" The manager is also waiting on players to return from injury but not for the trip to Forest. \"It will be a similar squad as we had against Villa,\" Ten Hag told reporters. \"MidJanuary we expect many players back. Mason Mount, Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez, Tyrell Malacia, so we expect Harry Maguire, of course.\" At the halfway point of the season, United are seventh in the standings, trailing leaders Liverpool by points. Despite their injury problems, United came back from down to beat highflying Villa, something which Ten Hag takes a lot of comfort from. \"We proved, despite all the setbacks, I think not any team can deal with so many setbacks as we had,\" the manager said. \"Number of points, we are not satisfied, but you have to be pleased. When we have all the players back, the squad is strong. Against Liverpool, Arsenal, Villa, the top three teams in the league, we went headto head... we can beat anyone.\" United take on a Forest side fresh from a win away to Newcastle United on Tuesday, in what was new manager Nuno Espirito Santo's second game in charge. \"With them, you see the reaction with a new manager coming in. You see the spirit, we have to be ready for that,\" Ten Hag said. Forest are th on points.",

MLS clubs voted to send teams from MLS Next Pro, a lower division developmental league formed two years ago comprising of their reserve players, as the U.S. Open Cup was not a priority and because they wanted to reduce fixture congestion. Founded in , the U.S. Open Cup features professional and amateur teams but MLS commissioner Don Garber had criticised the knockout tournament, saying it was a \"very poor reflection\" of what they were trying to achieve in the sport. \"Major League Soccer has requested to allow MLS Next PRO teams to represent MLS in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup,\" U.S. Soccer said in a statement. \"After thoughtful consideration, we have informed MLS that the U.S. Soccer staff recommendation, which was adopted by the Pro League Taskforce, is that the request be denied.\" The tournament does not have all its games broadcast while Garber said some games are played on poor pitches that are not up to professional standards. \"As we move forward, we will continue our review of the Open Cup to ensure it aligns with the U.S. Soccer strategic pillars,\" U.S. Soccer added. \"We remain committed to addressing the needs and concerns of all of our members, including MLS, and other stakeholders to enhance and improve the U.S. Open Cup.\" MLS had said on Saturday that the move to not send their first teams would free up six midweek match dates, but that they remain \"committed to working with U.S. Soccer to evolve and elevate the Open Cup\".

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Tottenham Hotspur have one of the worst disciplinary records in the Premier League this season but manager Ange Postecoglou said on Friday that he has no intention of having a word with his players as missing games would teach them a lesson. Spurs have had yellow cards in games this season while they are jointtop of the league with four red cards. Yves Bissouma has been sent off twice while Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie have one red card each. Two red cards in one game cost them in a defeat by Chelsea last month but ahead of Saturday's home game against Everton, Postecoglou said it was something the players had to learn from on their own. \"It's obviously something that is not great for us, because it's costing us during games, post games. The players are well aware of the impact that those kinds of things have and I'm sure they'll learn from those experiences,\" he told reporters. \"My experience in football is that the best remedy for those kinds of things is the players feeling like they're missing out on something. It brings them back into line pretty quickly. \"Hopefully we keep winning and the guys that miss out learn their lesson that way.\" Everton are on a fourmatch winning streak in the league which has propelled Sean Dyche's side up to th despite a for breaching profitability and sustainability rules. If not for the deduction, Everton would have been th, fighting for European spots. \"They've been one of the more consistent sides all year. I think Sean has done an outstanding job,\" Postecoglou said. \"When you do get hit with something like that, it's often the measure of the playing group and the manager how they respond to adversity. You've got to say their response has been first class. \"He and the players certainly haven't used it as an excuse. They're a good side, a really hardworking team. You've got to compete against them and we're expecting a really tough game tomorrow.\" Postecoglou said Spurs will have Giovani Lo Celso back from injury but confirmed James Maddison and Micky van de Ven were no closer to returning, with the pair expected back in action only next month.",

      "article_body": "BRUSSELS, Dec Reuters UEFA and FIFA contravened EU law by stopping the formation of a Super League, the European Court of Justice ECJ said on Thursday, but though breakaway organisers welcomed the ruling, major leagues and clubs moved quickly to support the status quo. The decision stirred up the arguments that swirled around the original Super League plan in as the ECJ has ruled against the principle of the governing bodies , but crucially added that the judgment did not necessarily mean such a league must be approved. The leading European clubs that proposed forming the breakaway league ESL, which sparked widespread protests among fans, had been threatened with sanctions by UEFA if they went ahead with the plan, leading to nine of them pulling out. Sports development company A, formed to assist with creating the ESL, had claimed UEFA and global governing body FIFA held a monopoly position which was in breach of the EU's Competition and Free Movement Law. Soon after the verdict A that would feature men's teams and women's teams competing in a midweek league, threatening UEFA's flagship Champions League tournament. In its ruling, the EU's top court said that FIFA and UEFA abused their dominant position by forbidding clubs to compete in a European Super League, although that project may still not be approved as the court did not rule on it specifically. UEFA, FIFA, Football Supporters Europe, LaLiga, the European Club Association, European Leagues and FIFPro Europe said in a joint statement \"There is no place for any type of 'super league' in Europe. Sporting merit is what counts.\" UEFA has organised panEuropean competitions for nearly years and sees the ESL project as a significant threat to the lucrative Champions League, for which teams qualify on merit. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and nine other top clubs announced the breakaway plan in April, . But the move collapsed within hours after an outcry from fans, governments and players forced Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid to pull out. A CEO Bernd Reichart said in an interview with Reuters that the new competition would win over fans by providing a tournament that was more competitive and by making it free to view on television. \"This is what makes this proposal so fancentric and so attractive to every fan,\" Reichart said. Shares in Juventus, listed on the Italian Stock Exchange, rose more than on prospects for a revived ESL, with trading having to be halted because of excessive volatility. UEFA said the ruling did not signify an endorsement or validation of the Super League and that it had addressed a shortfall which had been highlighted in its own framework. \"We will not try to stop them. They can create whatever they want. I hope they start their fantastic competition as soon as possible, with two clubs,\" UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin told a news conference. FIFA said it would analyse the decision in coordination with UEFA, other confederations and the member associations before commenting further. \"With the greatest respect for the European Court of Justice, today's judgement does not change anything, really,\" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said. \"Historically, we have been organising the best competitions in the world and this will also be the case in the future.\" Manchester United and Bayern Munich issued statements saying they remained committed to UEFA's competitions while domestic leagues across Europe . The UK government said it was working on legislation to prevent English clubs from joining another breakaway competition. Reichart said the ESL was not a breakaway league and that it would be compatible with domestic league calendars. Spain's LaLiga said \"Today, more than ever, we reiterate that the 'Super League' is a selfish and elitist model.\" The court's ruling said FIFA and UEFA must \"comply with the competition rules and respect the freedoms of movement\", adding that their rules on approval, control and sanctions amounted to \"unjustified restrictions on the freedom to provide services\". \"That does not mean that a competition such as the Super League project must necessarily be approved. The Court, having been asked generally about the FIFA and UEFA rules, does not rule on that specific project in its judgment,\" it concluded. After the collapse of the ESL plan, only three clubs remained in support of it, but Juventus opted to pull out this year after their former chairman Andrea Agnelli, one of the figures behind the project, and the club's board resigned in November . Real and Barcelona still hoped to go ahead with the competition and the ESL took its case to a Spanish court, which subsequently sought guidance from the Luxembourgbased European Court. Real Madrid President Florentino Perez said the ruling marked \"a before and after\" for football. \"The present and future of European football are finally in the hands of the clubs, the players and their fans,\" Perez said in a prerecorded video statement. Barcelona said they were satisfied with the ruling and that the creation of the ESL would allow football to address issues of fixture overload, putting \"local and international players and supporters at the centre\". \"The mediumterm sustainability of European football entails the need create a concept along the lines of the Super League,\" the club said in a statement. The ruling will now be considered by the Spanish court, where a judge can apply its responses to facts of the case.",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Chelsea and Fulham booked their place in the semifinals of the League Cup on Tuesday when they followed up draws with penaltyshootout wins over Newcastle United and Everton respectively, with Middlesbrough also making the last four. Chelsea beat Newcastle on penalties, at Stamford Bridge after substitute Mykhailo Mudryk kept the Blues alive with a ndminute equaliser, while Fulham defeated Everton in their shootout. Middlesbrough beat League One side Port Vale to cruise into the last four. Liverpool face West Ham United to decide the last semifinal spot on Wednesday. Newcastle had appeared set to snatch a win in west London until Kieran Trippier, on as a substitute, failed to cut out a Malo Gusto cross and allowed Mudryk, also on as a sub, to slot home, levelling the tie at and taking it to penalties. England defender Trippier turned a bad night into a disastrous one when he fired Newcastle's second penalty wide before Matt Ritchie saw his effort saved athletically by Chelsea's Djordje Petrovic, making only his second start in goal for the Blues. \"Trips is an incredibly strong character,\" Newcastle manager Eddie Howe told reporters. \"When he's given us so much, now's our turn to support him and look after him the other way and that's what we'll do.\" Chelsea had gone behind in the th minute when Callum Wilson, surrounded by Chelsea defenders, pounced on an error by Benoit Badiashile who got the ball caught in his feet allowing Wilson to flick his finish past Petrovic. The hosts dominated possession throughout the game but struggled to break down a welldrilled Newcastle defence. They brought French forward Christopher Nkunku off the bench for his first competitive appearance for the Londoners having suffered a knee injury in preseason shortly after his transfer from RB Leipzig. But the expensively assembled Blues, who have struggled for a second straight season in the Premier League, had seemed destined to throw away a precious chance of silverware until Mudryk's late strike. \"Obviously it means a lot. Sometimes things happen when you trust in each other and believe until the end,\" the Ukrainian who has struggled to find his feet since signing for Chelsea nearly a year ago told Sky Sports. \"Sometimes when the game is tough you need to keep pushing and believe until the last second because it's football and everything can happen.\" Mudryk was one of four Chelsea players to score in the shootout, along with Nkunku, Cole Palmer and Conor Gallagher. Chelsea, in their first season under Mauricio Pochettino, are pinning their hopes on the domestic cups as they currently sit th in the Premier League and did not qualify for European competition. The defeat for Howe's Newcastle without a major trophy since the s represents a second blow in the space of a week after they were eliminated from the Champions League last Wednesday. Everton's recent good run of results came to an end as they came back from a goal down to equalise with eight minutes remaining, but Fulham got the better of them from the penalty spot to silence the home crowd. Toffees defender Michael Keane turned the ball into his own net early on to give Fulham the lead at Goodison Park, but a goal from substitute Beto eight minutes form time threw the home side a lifeline. Both keepers saved a spot kick before Everton's Idrissa Gueye struck a post with his hasty effort, and Fulham centre back Tosin Adarabioyo stepped up score to put the Londoners into the last four of the competition for the first time in their history.",

But Liege, who are struggling in Belgium's topflight and lie in th place, said the situation will be remedied on Friday and they will be able to attract new players from January. The soccer club, who are owned by Partners, are seeking to take majority ownership of English club Everton but are awaiting regulatory approval from the Premier League. The transfer will be lifted once outstanding payments have been made and Liege said this will occur in the next day or two. \"As indicated to the Licence Commission yesterday, the club's shareholder will transfer the necessary funds to regularise the situation today,\" Liege said in a statement. \"The club is therefore confident that the sanction ... will be lifted. The possibility of attracting players from January is therefore in no way up for question,\" it added.",

      "article_body": "CAPE TOWN, Jan Reuters Winger Nicolas Moumi Ngamaleu will make his return to the Cameroon selection after being named on Thursday as a late replacement in their Africa Cup of Nations squad headed to the Ivory Coast later this month. The yearold Ngamaleu was one of his country's key players when they hosted the finals two years ago but was omitted from the original squad for this tournament, which kicks off next Saturday. He also played at the World Cup finals. He comes in at the last moment to replace uncapped teenager Regis Mughe, who has elected to stay with his French club Olympique de Marseille rather than go with the Indomitable Lions. Cameroon are among several countries forced to make late changes as the deadline for the submission of squads passed on Wednesday. After losing forward Amine Gouiri, Algeria will now have to do without veteran goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi, who has also suffered an injury. The yearold was approaching his th cap but is replaced by Saudibased Mustafa Zaghba, the Algerian federation said. Egypt have lost uncapped Ahmed Nabil Kouka, who had been in top form for African champions Al Ahly and was an exciting callup, to a foot injury suffered in training. He is replaced by Mohanad Lashin. Fullback Osama Galal, who suffered a knee injury, was replaced on Wednesday by Yasser Ibrahim, whose original omission from the squad had been widely criticised by pundits in Egypt. Tunisia have allowed Mortadha Ben Ouanes to withdraw for what the federation said were family reasons and replaced the Turkishbased striker with Seifeddine Jaziri. The yearold Jaziri was Tunisias lead attacker at the last Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon two years ago. Mauritania goalkeeper Babacar Diop underwent surgery on Wednesday after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in training in Tunisia, where they are preparing for the tournament. A replacement has yet to be announced. The participating countries had until Wednesday to name their squads, which can be a maximum of players but also have until kickoff in their first game to replace injured players, but only after producing medical evidence.",

      "article_body": "LIVERPOOL, England, Jan Reuters Mohamed Salah's secondhalf brace made up for a missed penalty as Liverpool kicked off the new year three points clear atop the Premier League standings with a victory over Newcastle United at a raindrenched Anfield on Monday. Juergen Klopp's team, who began the day level with Aston Villa on points, now have from games. Villa have points while Manchester City, who have played one fewer game, are third on . Newcastle are ninth on . \"It was a sensational game from my team,\" Klopp told BBC. \"We started extremely lively. Super game. I loved so many aspects of the game bar the goals we conceded. \"Unbelievable atmosphere. Counterpressing wise it was for football schools,\" he added. \"They have to watch that, take it and keep it. It was everything good.\" The yearold Salah, who has Premier League goals for Liverpool, changed his boots at halftime and the switch paid off handsomely. His two goals moved him even with City's Erling Haaland as joint top scorers with goals. He is the joint top on assists, level with Villa's Ollie Watkins on eight. Liverpool dominated the game, and Salah, who had fired a firsthalf penalty straight at goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, finally broke the deadlock in the th minute when Darwin Nunez cut the ball across to the Egyptian for a closerange finish. Alexander Isak scored against the run of play with Newcastle's second shot of the game in the th minute when he ran onto a through ball from Anthony Gordon and knocked it past keeper Alisson into the far corner. However, Curtis Jones put the home side back in front in the th minute with a tapin after a pass across goal from Diogo Jota, and Cody Gakpo scored four minutes later. Sven Botman pulled one back for Newcastle in the st before Salah, who was playing his last game before departing for the African Cup of Nations, struck from the penalty spot after Jota had been fouled by Dubravka to seal the win in the th. \"Crazy match. Both sides created chances,\" Dubravka, , told Sky Sports. \"I was there to try to help my team mates. Unfortunately they created so many chances and were clinical.\" Liverpool were on the front foot against Newcastle virtually from kickoff, and a superb display by keeper Dubravka kept the visitors in the game. The hosts had shots in the first half to Newcastle's one, their most in the first half of a Premier League game since April against Everton. Liverpool's early chances were met by groans from the Anfield crowd, including Trent AlexanderArnold's strike following Salah's missed penalty that he launched well over the crossbar. AlexanderArnold also had a long shot at a tight angle hit the far post. But they finally found the net after the break and the floodgates opened. \"It's a great result for us. The game was very intense and we managed to pick up three points and now we are top of the table. We need to stay calm and win every game,\" Salah told Sky Sports. \"The players spoke in the dressing room at halftime. 'We have to stay calm'. I missed the pen. I didn't want to leave for the national team with that performance.\" Newcastle have now lost four of their last five league matches and face champions Manchester City on Jan. after their FA Cup third round meeting with fierce rivals Sunderland on Saturday. \"A lot happened. Action packed game. We're disappointed with the way we defended,\" Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said. Howe argued Salah's second penalty, awarded when Dubravka dove in to stop Jota and the Liverpool player appeared to take two steps before stumbling, should not have stood. \"It shouldn't be given. Martin has pulled his hand away. He's had two steps before going down. For me it's not a penalty,\" Howe said. \"We feel hard done by.\"",

The lowly Catalan side have forged ahead and sit alone at the top of the standings on points, two ahead of Real Madrid and nine clear of last season's champions Barcelona in third. Girona's stunning start to the LaLiga season scaled new heights last week when they claimed a over Barca their first league win over their Catalan rivals and they kept the ball rolling against Alaves. They dominated proceedings with the same intensity they have shown this season, with their defeat at home to Real Madrid in late September, the only major blip in a stunning start to the campaign. Dovbyk opened the scoring in the rd minute with a closerange strike from a rebound off the goalkeeper and Portu extended their lead just before the break with a fine firsttime effort from the edge of the box. Most of the hosts' scoring opportunities came from the right side of their attack, with yearold Brazil fullback Yan Couto troubling Alaves' defence with his speed and skill. On one of his sprints up the wing, he knocked the ball through a defender's legs to get into the box before being fouled from behind in the th minute, earning a penalty that Ukrainian Dovbyk netted with a tidy finish right down the middle of the goal. The win was Girona's th in games, giving them the most wins and points in Europe's top five leagues at this stage of the season. Their remarkable run has fuelled belief that they are equipped to challenge for a maiden title only two seasons after gaining promotion to the top flight. \"This team is so hungry that it doesn't settle for anything,\" Portu told Movistar Plus. \"The team wants more and we only think day to day about continuing. \"We can't look at the standings. The key to the team is to stay focused, nobody relaxes here. It's not easy to get used to winning, to have that extra pressure... but the team is handling it very well.\"",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters The availability of several key Newcastle United players remains in question as manager Eddie Howe tries to field the best possible side in Tuesday's League Cup quarterfinal against Chelsea. Defender Fabian Schar and midfielder Joelinton, injured during Newcastle's win over Fulham on Sunday, had scans that didn't seem \"too bad\" but were not a certainty, Howe told reporters on Monday. \"To miss Fabby would be a big blow,\" he said, referring to Schar. Forward Alexander Isak also missed Sunday's match with a groin injury but it was not too serious, Howe added. \"We need to treat him carefully to make sure he isn't out for six or seven weeks. He has a chance for tomorrow but we need to be careful,\" the English coach said. But one major boost for Newcastle was centreback Sven Botman's return from a threemonth knee injury. \"There are certain players who lift the team in particular and Sven is one of those. He gives players confidence around him and makes a big difference,\" Howe added. Newcastle have never won the League Cup, finishing as runnersup in and last season. However, Howe believed their experience of getting to Wembley in February was helping them in this campaign. \"We've seen the rewards you can get from it. The build up to the final was a brilliant thing to be part of ... it was incredible to see how many fans we took to London. It's helped us this year,\" he said. Chelsea have more of a pedigree in the competition, having won the League Cup five times, most recently in . They have struggled this season though their home form has vastly improved since the end of October. However, Howe was confident Newcastle could end their fivematch winless streak in away matches in all competitions. \"We beat Manchester United away and were seconds away from beating Paris St Germain. I don't doubt our character. We're certainly up for the fight,\" he said.",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Fulham denied Arsenal the opportunity to end the year top of the Premier League after they fought back from a goal down to claim a win on Sunday. Bukayo Saka's early goal was cancelled out by Raul Jimenez before Bobby De CordovaReid's secondhalf strike ended the hosts' threematch losing streak. Fulham rose to th in the table with points after matches. Arsenal, who were top of the table on Christmas day, have ended the year fourth after going winless in their last three matches. The visitors started the match on the frontfoot and found the breakthrough just five minutes in as Gabriel Martinelli ran into the box from the left and went for the finish. Fulham keeper Bernd Leno's diving parry denied Martinelli, but the ball went to Saka who finished from close range. The hosts were unshaken by the early setback and continued to build pressure, which paid off near the halfhour mark as Tom Cairney's cross from the left flank was met by Jimenez for a swift finish, restoring parity. Marco Silva's side maintained the momentum into the second half and took the lead near the hourmark, when Andreas Pereira's corner created a scramble in the Arsenal box before De CordovaReid fired it into the net. Fulham almost scored their third when Pereira's late free kick rattled the crossbar. \"It was very good reaction after the first goal. The way we beat their pressure and began to play our way,\" Silva told BBC Sport. The result marked the first time Fulham won a game after going a goal down in league matches. \"Really the best way to finish , definitely. Our ambition was to finish on a high and react from the last two games,\" Silva added. \"I really believe we deserve it. Over the minutes we deserved it more.\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said it was \"a sad day\" to see his team end the year on two straight losses. \"Today was our worst game of the season. The pace, the purpose we have in attack, defensively we were second best,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Not enough purpose speed or threat. We were sloppy with the ball. It wasn't good enough. We didn't deserve to win,\" Arteta added.",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Burnley shocked Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday to give their fans an early Christmas present with just their third victory of the Premier League season as Vincent Kompany's side moved off the bottom of the table. In a game marked by Rebecca Welch becoming the first female referee to officiate a Premier League match, Fulham dominated the first half but secondhalf goals from Wilson Odobert and Sander Berge saw Burnley move up to th with points. The win will give Burnley's survival hopes a shot in the arm while Fulham failed to move into the top half of the table, with Marco Silva's side dropping to th after a second straight defeat. \"We believe in the whole process. The performances have been there and it was only a matter of time before the results came,\" Burnley keeper James Trafford, who made several saves, told BBC Match of the Day. Fulham took their time to get going but once they did Trafford was kept busy, making saves from Harry Wilson and Joao Palhinha while Alex Iwobi fired just wide all in the span of two minutes. There was no respite for Trafford and his defensive line, who were called into action several times in the first half as the home side's players lined up to shoot. At the other end, Trafford's counterpart Bernd Leno was rarely called into action as Burnley struggled to mount attacks and failed to have a single shot on target. But Burley turned the tables less than two minutes after the restart when they won the ball back from Fulham and Odobert played a quick onetwo pass with Lyle Foster before curling an effort from range past Leno to make it . A shellshocked Fulham looked to recover but Burnley delivered the knockout blow minutes later. Berge picked up the ball at the half line, stormed through the middle and though he had support, he saw the lack of any challenges as an invitation to pull the trigger from over yards out as Leno was beaten yet again. \"We started in the worst way possible, second half, conceding a goal in the first minute... Unfortunately, we conceded a second goal in a way that cannot happen,\" Silva said. Fulham failed to muster anything of note after going down as Burnley kept their first clean sheet away from home in the league this season. \"In the first half we weren't at our best. We came in at halftime and the manager and staff gave us some points on how we could really punish them. We scored two brilliant goals,\" Trafford added. \"I'm delighted with the clean sheet but more delighted with three points. The whole team really values wins and clean sheets. We have never really been short of confidence as a team.\"",

      "article_body": "MANCHESTER, England, Dec Reuters Smile a bit more and you will win was Pep Guardiola's halftime message to his Manchester City team and it worked out well as they beat Sheffield United on Saturday. City will end unbeaten on home soil, but three successive Premier League draws at The Etihad Stadium had shaken the confidence of his champions. So while City had bossed the first half and led through Rodri's early strike, Guardiola detected negative vibes among his players as they walked in to the dressing room. \"We were uncomfortable the last three times we were here,\" the Spaniard told reporters after the win that lifted City into third place, two points behind leaders Liverpool. \"The first part was silent. The body language of players didn't communicate, talk, laugh, or shout. It was a little bit, 'okay we have to play'. \"At halftime for the first time I didn't talk one word about tactics I took a chair and said 'guys when you go out with a smile on your face and enjoy, we are going to win'. \"In the second half, the first to minutes was the best minutes we had, and that helped us win the game.\" Julian Alvarez wrapped up the points as City brought their epic, treblewinning year to a close with a stressfree win. City seem to have overcome their wobble in form and with Kevin de Bruyne back for the first time since the opening day of the season and goal machine Erling Haaland also returning soon after injury, City seem well placed for a surge that could take them to a fourth successive Premier League title. \"We made in the past a lot of winning streaks, but never during that time did we think how many we were going to win,\" Guardiola said. \"We only thought about the next game. \"We felt in title races against Liverpool that if we lose a game we are not going to win the Premier League and that's why they pushed us to the highest level. \"The position we are in is more than fine. We are going to lose games, they are going to lose games. We're trying to lose as few as possible.\" As well as winning the Premier League, the FA Cup and, for the first time, the Champions League to claim the treble, City were also crowned world champions last week. But they are not about to relax in . \"It's been incredible, as a team and for me, has been the best year and I'm so glad for that,\" Rodri, who scored the goal against Inter Milan that won the Champions League in Istanbul in June, told the BBC. \"I think this team wants even more, we want to have everyone back fit, and I think in the second half of the season will be even better.\"",

Monza had the opportunity to grab the win from the spot following a handball by Juan Jesus but Matteo Pessina's tame effort in the th minute was easily saved by Alex Meret. The draw leaves Napoli in seventh place with points, five points off the top four places and adrift of leaders Inter Milan, who visit Genoa later on Friday. Monza are th on . Fiorentina moved up to fourth after a goal by Luca Ranieri in the rd minute secured a home win over Torino. \"I am not worried by the table, my focus is on getting my lads to play well and today that is what they did,\" Napoli manager Walter Mazzarri told DAZN. \"The only regret is that we failed to score a goal, but we deserved to win or .\" Napoli missed the finishing of the suspended Victor Osimhen who was sent off in their at AS Roma last weekend. AndreFrank Zambo Anguissa had a golden opportunity to break the deadlock shortly before halftime with a closeangle volley, but Monza's Michele Di Gregorio made a superb reaction save. Napoli's Khvicha Kvaratskhelia then struck a shot from just outside the box that missed the post by inches. He had another chance early in the second half in a oneonone with Di Gregorio, who saved the attempt with his legs. At the end frustration boiled over for Mazzarri, leading to his dismissal following an altercation, while Monza coach Raffaele Palladino also received a red card in stoppage time for comments made to the referee. \"At one point, it looked like a game of rugby more than football,\" Mazzarri said. \"I went over to the referee and told him that Kvara Kvaratskhelia was not allowed to play because he was systematically fouled. The rules have to be applied.\" Monza's unused substitute, Mirko Maric, was shown a red card deep into stoppage time, seemingly for kicking a ball away. Napoli start the New Year with a visit to Torino on Jan. .",

Roma, missing several key players such as forwards Romelu Lukaku and Paulo Dybala due to injuries and suspension, struggled to match Bologna's aggression, failed to retain possession and were never able to control the match. \"Without Paulo, there is no quality in this squad. Without Romelu, there is no physicality in this squad. Without either of them, I knew it would be tough for us,\" Roma manager Jose Mourinho told DAZN, adding that he wanted to stay with the club beyond the end of the season when his contract expires. \"I will tell you something I have not yet said, because I did not want to say it. I want to continue at Roma. I want to continue here,\" Mourinho said. The victory took Bologna to points from games, a point above Napoli and Fiorentina, while Roma are seventh with . Bologna broke the deadlock eight minutes before halftime when Moro netted first time after Dan Ndoye pulled the ball back from the byline. Four minutes into the second half the hosts went further ahead when the ball deflected off Roma's Kristensen into his own net after Lewis Ferguson's cross was missed by Ndoye. \"I could tell obviously the players wanted to do better but if we had no tactical problems when they scored the first goal, it was a very balanced match we did have huge difficulties on a physical level,\" Mourinho said. \"Bologna have players with intensity, engine and legs, whereas we do not have those characteristics.\" Roma will host Napoli in Serie A next Saturday, while Bologna's next fixture will be against Inter Milan in the Coppa Italia round of on Wednesday.",

      "article_body": "MANCHESTER, England, Dec Reuters Rasmus Hojlund's first Premier League goal secured a win for Manchester United over Aston Villa after Alejandro Garnacho had scored a brace to claw their way back from two goals down in a breathless encounter on Tuesday. \"Keep believing. I think our fans they deserved it. They are always behind us and we've had so many setbacks,\" United manager Erik ten Hag told the BBC. \"So I'm really pleased from the performance of this team. What kind of team can handle and deal with the amount of setbacks we have had\" United, who had fans booing them off the Old Trafford pitch at halftime, climbed to sixth in the standings on points, while Villa, who lost for the first time in games in all competitions, are third with , missing a chance to move even on points with leagueleaders Liverpool. \"The atmosphere pushed them. They have very good players,\" Villa manager Unai Emery said. After , minutes, Hojlund finally ended his league goal drought in the nd when a United corner bounced off John McGinn's knee and fell to the Dane. The yearold swiped it in off the post and a few minutes later left the game to a standing ovation. \"It has been a while waiting, but yes I am very happy. I am the happiest man alive right now,\" Hojlund told Amazon Prime. \"You can see from the celebrations as well. We believed in ourselves until the very end and got the win today.\" McGinn scored for Villa in the st minute from a long free kick that sailed past several players and into the bottom left corner. Leander Dendoncker doubled their lead five minutes later from close range when an unmarked Clement Lenglet headed a corner kick back across goal. United appeared headed for their ninth defeat in league games before Garnacho netted his first in the th minute with a fierce shot from the centre of the box. He equalised for the hosts in the st after a giveandgo with Bruno Fernandes before Hojlund scored the winner. \"It is a great feeling. We are Manchester United. We were twonil down, but we never give up, and it was a great comeback from the team,\" Garnacho said. United, who played for the first time since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe struck a deal on Christmas Eve to take a minority stake in the club, looked done and dusted at halftime, but their secondhalf transformation was remarkable. Garnacho believed he had pulled one back for United minutes after halftime when Marcus Rashford delivered a pinpoint pass and he calmly went around goalkeeper Emi Martinez and slotted home, but VAR showed he was offside. United continued to attack in waves, with seven shots on target to Villa's four, and were finally rewarded in the final half hour. Hojlund, who signed for United in August from Atalanta, had five goals in four Champions League games but the striker's lack of league scoring had raised questions in recent weeks. He answered them on Tuesday, and Ten Hag, Garnacho and keeper Andre Onana took turns wrapping the young player in hugs after the final whistle. \"Yes I remember the goal,\" Hojlund said. \"Firsttime finish in off the post, good finish so I am happy. I am happy for the three of us attackers as well because we showed a lot of character today, and a lot of confidence.\"",

The win moved Real up to points, three ahead of surprise package Girona, who host thirdplaced Atletico Madrid later on Wednesday. Centre back Rudiger broke the deadlock in the th minute as he capitalised on some sloppy defending from Luka Modric's corner to power a header into the top corner and score his first goal of the season. \"Great cross by Luka, great block by Dani Carvajal and luckily it went in,\" Rudiger told reporters. \"I'm happy because it was an important goal and three important points for us. This team has something special, a good mix of young and old talent.\" Mallorca had mounted a resilient defensive display and came close to shocking Real with two efforts that hit the woodwork. Vinicius Jr also went close to scoring on his return to action after being sidelined with an injury but Mallorca keeper Predrag Rajkovic made a superb save to deny the Brazilian in the first half. \"It's always a difficult game when you come back from holidays,\" Real defender Carvajal told Real Madrid TV. \"Mallorca played a tactically very good game, very aggressive in defence. The set piece gave us the victory.\" \"We close the first half of the season as possible leaders, points is a lot. In the second half we'll be looking to surpass them.\" Real next visit fifthtier Arandina in the first round of the Spanish Cup before taking on Atletico Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup.",

      "article_body": "BIRMINGHAM, England, Dec Reuters A goal deep into stoppage time by substitute Nicolo Zaniolo snatched a draw for Aston Villa at home to Sheffield United on Friday as the Blades brought their hosts' match winning run at home in the league to an end. The draw sees Sheffield United climb off the bottom of the table to th spot on nine points, one ahead of bottom side Burnley, while Villa remain in third place on points, one behind leaders Arsenal. Villa came into the game knowing that a win would send them to the top of the table as the busy Christmas period gets underway, but they almost came unstuck as Sheffield United took the lead late on after a stalwart defensive performance. The home side dominated the game until late on, enjoying almost possession, but they were left frustrated by the solid defensive block of the Blades, which limited them to a single shot on target until Zaniolo's late header. The visitors were lucky to survive an early VAR review after Vinicius Souza appeared to push Villa striker Ollie Watkins in the back before he headed a cross behind, and they escaped two further penalty reviews from the resulting corner. Sheffield United keeper Wes Foderingham made a smart onehanded save to deny Moussa Diaby in the th minute, and four minutes later Ezri Konsa should have opened the scoring for Villa, but he could not keep his header from a corner down. The Blades benefited from another favourable VAR decision on the hour mark when Leon Bailey's goal for Villa was ruled out for a foul on keeper Wes Foderingham, and they defended doggedly to set up a grandstand finish. Cameron Archer, who joined Villa from the Blades in August, scored what looked to be the winner for his side in the th minute, but Zaniolo struck his first Premier League goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time to salvage a point for his side. \"It's the least we deserved, but to concede a goal that late is bitterly disappointing,\" United keeper Foderingham, who kicked a goalpost in frustration after the ball flew past him, told Sky Sports. Zaniolo said that his side was equally disappointed with the result. \"Today was a very important match and the whole team thought we have to win. Of course, I'm happy for my first goal in the Premier League, but I prefer three points,\" he said.",

I can't be in the goal at or , I should step aside for other good players.\" Courtois, , was in October, after he needed surgery on a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee he suffered during a training session. He said his decision to sit out Euro in Germany doesn't have to be a final farewell from the national team, even though he on the squad in June after a spat with coach Domenico Tedesco. At the time, Tedesco said Courtois had felt overlooked for the team's captaincy, but the goalkeeper said it was a lack of overall appreciation that prompted him to leave. \"That was the wrong decision, for which I apologise to the team and the fans,\" said Courtois, who has been capped for Belgium times since . \"I still love to play for the national team. But this season I have to focus on Real Madrid, the European Championship does not fit in the picture of a perfect comeback.\"",

      "article_body": "NEWCASTLE, England, Dec Reuters Nottingham Forest striker Chris Wood scored a superb hattrick against his former club Newcastle United at St James' Park on Tuesday to give his struggling side a muchneeded victory in the Premier League. Forest's first win under new coach Nuno Espirito Santo lifted them to th in the table on points, five above the relegation zone, while Newcastle's fourth defeat in their last five league games left them seventh on points. It was another dull, disjointed performance from a Magpies side who had only conceded four goals at home this season, only to allow a striker deemed surplus to requirements to score three times in one game. Newcastle took the lead in the rd minute when Alexander Isak won a penalty as he tried to spin away from Forest full back Ola Aina, and the Swedish striker stepped up to stroke home the spotkick low to left of keeper Matt Turner. Wood, who was loaned to Forest by Newcastle in January before being signed permanently, brought his side level just before the break with a closerange tapin from Anthony Elanga's centre. Forest's Morgan GibbsWhite flashed a header just wide and Elanga should have put the visitors ahead six minutes after the break, but his weak effort with the goal at his mercy was easily dealt with by Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka. Newcastle's defence failed to heed those warnings, however, and Wood put them ahead in the rd minute with a brilliant solo effort from another counterattack, dinking the ball past Dubravka with his left foot after a clever run. Newcastle enjoyed plenty of possession but once again their attack struggled to gel. Only Isak looked dangerous when he got hold of the ball around the Forest box, and the visitors were always ready to pounce once the attacks broke down. New Zealand international Wood completed his hattrick on the hour mark with another welltaken goal on the counter, rounding Dubravka and coolly slotting home to secure a welldeserved win. Wood's goal celebrations during were muted, but he couldn't hide his delight as he took the applause of the Forest fans at the final whistle. \"It is nice coming back to Newcastle, I really enjoyed my time here, it is a great bunch of lads and staff,\" he told the BBC. \"We needed three points and it was fantastic for the side to get it. This is a tough place to come, the boys did extremely well.\"",

Klinsmann has included Tottenham Hotspur's Son in his man squad as well as Bayern Munich defender Kim Minjae, Paris SaintGermain's Lee Kangin and Wolverhampton Wanderers' Hwang Heechan in an attempt to win a first title since . \"When you go through the roster and you go through the skeleton of a team ... I think you can be really proud as Korean fans and journalists,\" Klinsmann told a media conference in Seoul on Thursday. \"We have a lot of different pieces in that roster and that makes us one of the favourites for the Asian Cup. \"What we need to do is to finetune these elements in the next couple of weeks and then go into that tournament with confidence and with the willingness to win the title.\" The Koreans are one of the continent's traditional powers and have qualified for every World Cup since , reaching the semifinals in when they cohosted the tournament with neighbours Japan. But their recent record at regional level is disappointing, with the country not winning the continent's premier title since the second of backtoback successes were secured in . The Koreans claimed that title ahead of Israel, who were kicked out of the Asian Football Confederation in , as well as the Republic of China now Taiwan and South Vietnam. Since then there have been runnersup finishes in , , and, most recently, in , when a Soninspired side lost out in extra time to an Ange Postecogloucoached Australia. \"A competition like this is about timing,\" said Klinsmann, whose team will face Bahrain in their group stage opener on Jan. before taking on Jordan and Malaysia. \"You want your players to peak exactly at this time, when this tournament happens. \"I have a good feeling because the players are doing well in their clubs, they're healthy, they're fit, they're ambitious and they're very hungry. This is the foundation for playing a good tournament. \"Once the tournament starts it all needs to fall into place and you need a little bit of luck too. \"It's years, and years is a long time for Korea, so it's about time we get this done.\"",

      "article_body": "MANCHESTER, England, Dec Reuters British members of parliament are calling for the creation of a new criminal offence of unlawfully entering a soccer match, plus better collaboration between United Kingdom and overseas police to improve safety at sports event at home and abroad. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee report \"Safety at major sporting events\" released on Friday was made after its inquiry into fan safety during the Euro final at Wembley and chaotic scenes involving Liverpool supporters at the Champions League final. \"Fans flocking to festive fixtures at this time of year should be able to enjoy time with family and friends in sports grounds that are secure, inclusive and welcoming environments,\" committee chair Caroline Dinenage said. \"Sadly, the rise in disorder at football postpandemic and near disasters that occurred at Wembley and in Paris have shown there is much to be done to ensure a safe time for all.\" The report said the treatment of Liverpool fans by French authorities at the Champions League final was \"disgraceful\", and that the attitude of foreign police forces to UK football fans heavily contributed to the chaos. Dinenage said tailgating and other forms of unauthorised entry into grounds were an increasing problem at highprofile matches and put safety at risk from overcrowding. \"Those involved should know that they will face consequences and the Government should back legislation to ensure they can be banned,\" she said. The committee said the lack of a distinct criminal penalty that includes the use of Football Banning Orders is allowing unauthorised entry to continue unchallenged, and it is calling on the government to pass into law the Unauthorised Entry to Football Matches Bill. Among other recommendations were that sports bodies should increase their financial contribution toward the safety of fans outside stadiums, and that the government should introduce a centralised system to report discrimination and antisocial behaviour at matches.",

      "article_body": "ALGIERS, Jan Reuters Algeria have confirmed the withdrawal of striker Amine Gouiri from their squad for the African Cup of Nations but have yet to make a decision on a potential replacement. Coach Djamel Belmadi had named the Stade Rennais striker in his original man selection for the tournament in the Ivory Coast, which kicks off next week, but a knee injury has ended any chance of participation. Belmadi said he was unaware of Gouiris injury when he selected him last Friday and said his French club had been slow in sharing information on his medical condition. Gouiri played in Rennes' last Ligue game on Dec. against Clermont Foot, coming off in the th minute. But the club have since denied tardy sharing of information. Following the statement of the Algeria coach, Stade Rennais would like to clarify that all information relating to the health of Amine Gouiri was transmitted in due time to his national team so that the latter could make a decision regarding his participation at the Cup of Nations, it said on Tuesday. Stade Rennais is disappointed for its striker who will miss a major international competition, the club's statement added. Persuading the yearold to switch his international allegiance from France, for whom he scored goals in appearances at under level, had been a major boost for Algeria. Gouiri made his debut in October and has made a total of four appearances for the Algerians. Countries competing at the team Cup of Nations can pick up to players for the finals, which opens up the possibility of West Ham United forward Said Benrahma participating after being a surprise omission last week.",

That's why we didn't win today, because in the first half we had the chances to score,\" Pochettino told reporters. \"In the Premier League if you're not clinical enough when you have chances, always you can concede. We didn't compete in the first five minutes of the second half, we conceded too many corners. In these moments it's about competing better and being stronger. \"I agree we're our own enemy. I don't want to take credit away from Wolves. They scored and they did their job. But in the first half we were the better side. And because of lack of capacity to score, we didn't win the game.\" Chelsea, th in the standings, next host Crystal Palace on Wednesday before travelling to Luton Town on Saturday.",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Lorenzo Pellegrini and Romelu Lukaku scored to give AS Roma a home win over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday as Matteo Politano and Victor Osimhen were sent off for the visitors. Roma moved up to sixth place on points, one ahead of Napoli who dropped to seventh. Walter Mazzarri has now lost five games from eight in all competitions since taking over from Rudi Garcia in November. The opening goal of a nervy game came in the th minute when Pellegrini, only on the pitch five minutes, hit a halfvolley on the turn into the top corner when the ball fell to him after a mishit shot from Stephan El Shaarawy. Champions Napoli were already down to men after Politano was sent off in the th minute for kicking out at Nicola Zalewski when the Roma player pulled him back by his jersey. Osimhen picked up a second yellow card in the th minute, and Napoli had goalkeeper Alex Meret to thank for keeping the score at before Lukaku wrapped up the win in the th minute with Napoli chasing a late equaliser. From a counterattack, Lukaku picked up possession inside the Napoli half and passed the ball to Ndicka who played it back for the Belgian striker to fire his shot into the net. In the first half, the referee reached for the yellow card on six occasions, including booking both managers, as Napoli dominated possession, and it was Roma who looked the more dangerous side. \"Maybe you don't agree, but my feeling is that right after minutes we would have won the game,\" Roma manager Jose Mourinho told DAZN. \"Roma came in very, very well, we were always in control against a much stronger team from a technical point of view.\" The first chance fell to Roma when Lukaku laid a pass back to Edoardo Bove and his shot from the edge of the area clipped the crossbar. The game was still a cagey affair until Politano's moment of madness. Mourinho made a triplechange, and it was Pellegrini who made the biggest impact with his first touch of the ball. \"Then with men we had an advantage, we took advantage of it well with the changes and with our interpretation. I think it's a welldeserved victory,\" Mourinho said. Napoli pushed for an equaliser but created no real chances, and Meret was quick off his line to palm away a Lukaku effort before Osimhen's red card ended Napoli's hopes. Bologna moved back up to fourth spot as a late goal from Lewis Ferguson gave them a win over Atalanta.",

If he is there, its because he is ready. I am sure that he will be available before our first match against Gambia, the coach told a press conference on Friday. Defender Youssouf Sabaly was also named in the squad as he has returned to training at Real Betis although he has not played since August. Frenchbased midfielder Nampalys Mendy will also be heading to Ivory Coast despite being sidelined in recent weeks.

Hojlund was signed in the close season for a reported fee of million pounds . million from Atalanta after he netted goals last season. Although the yearold was United's top scorer in the Champions League group stage with five goals, he has not found the net in appearances in England's top flight. \"We are open, he is open. His mentality is great. I think he is a very good performer under stress and he deals with that,\" Ten Hag told reporters ahead of Saturday's trip to West Ham United. \"But it's not only about Rasmus Hojlund, it's about Marcus Rashford, it's also about Alejandro Garnacho, it's also about Antony, it's also about Bruno Fernandes and Scott McTominay. \"Don't forget our full backs, who have to play a big part in that. I'm sure we will improve and especially if our squad is full. If it is better balanced, we should create more chances.\" United have failed to score in their last three games, losing to Bournemouth and Bayern Munich before a goalless draw at Liverpool. \"We know we have to improve, we played good in those games, but we should have created more chances and we should have been more clinical,\" the Dutch manager said. \"It's not about one player, it's about the group of us. As you know, in my philosophy, we have to attack with players. \"We have to get the movements better, the decisionmaking on the ball has to be better and sometimes also we have to be more clinical.\" Ten Hag still has injuries and illness to contend with as United look to improve on seventh place in the standings. \"We have some doubts, some illnesses during the week so we have to see who is available for tomorrow. Hopefully, they are recovered, but we have to see,\" he said. \"Casemiro and Lisandro Martinez are not available before Christmas, so midJanuary we expect them back. \"Mason Mount is similar, into January. Harry Maguire, I expect him earlier and Victor Lindelof is not available. He has had surgery, so he will be out for a couple of weeks.\" . pounds",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters A European court's ruling that the continent's soccer governing body UEFA and its global counterpart FIFA breached EU law by boxing out a proposed competitor could be a longterm threat to their dominance, even if the immediate impact is limited, legal experts say. The Thursday ruling by the European Court of Justice came alongside a decision against speed skating's governing body that could also check the monopoly powers of governing bodies across European sports, where they function as both top regulators and market participants. \"Whole sports movements are looking at their governance procedures now and thinking about how they can continue to control their sports in a way that's compatible with EU competition laws,\" said Edge Hill University law professor Richard Parrish. The ECJ ruled UEFA and FIFA contravened competition law by preventing clubs from forming a European Super League, rejecting the idea that sports governing bodies can arbitrarily ban members who participate in competitions set up without their approval. The ruling, which does not itself greenlight the Super League, requires UEFA and FIFA to have rules around participation in competitor leagues that are \"transparent, objective, nondiscriminatory and proportionate,\" creating potential openings for upstarts. \"What will likely happen now is some sort of arrangement behind closed doors to allow some sort of panEuropean league,\" said Grahame Anderson, a barrister at Littleton Chambers. UEFA had already updated its rules in in anticipation of a ruling like Thursday's and says it believes it is now compliant with \"all relevant European laws and regulations.\" The change in the legal landscape weakens its position in negotiations with potential rivals. The new rules could make it difficult for UEFA to justify rejecting a prospective competitor tournament that satisfies its new rules or mimics its structure. \"So what happens if the Super League or someone else says, we want to set up a league exactly like UEFA's,\" Parrish said. \"What grounds would UEFA have to block that\" The Super League itself has widely been considered dead since UK Premier League clubs withdrew in response to backlash in , though a rump version is still fighting UEFA and FIFA in a Spanish court. Top backers including Real Madrid and Barcelona hailed Thursday's ruling as a watershed moment for competition in soccer. Barcelona said in a statement that the ECJ ruling \"paves the way for a new elite level football competition in Europe by opposing the monopoly over the football world.\"",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Angola recalled strikers Jeremie Bela and Mbala Nzola to their squad for the African Cup of Nations finals as they became the first team to name their selection for next months tournament in the Ivory Coast. Coach Pedro Goncalves named players on Monday, despite the Confederation of African Football saying last week that the participating countries would be allowed strong squads for the finals, which kick off on Jan. . Bela, previously at Birmingham City, last played for Angola two years ago and is a surprise inclusion considering injuries have restricted his playing time this season for Ligue s bottom club Clermont Foot. Nzola, who plays for Fiorentina, had refused to play for Angola over the last month in protest at poor logistical arrangements around the last Cup of Nations qualifiers in June, but has been persuaded to return. Goncalves left out former Portugal international Helder Costa, who has not played this season after terminating his contract with Leeds United. Another former Portugal international Ivan Cavaleiro earlier this year switched allegiance to Angola but despite several callups he failed to make his debut and is not included in the squad. Goncalves said Cavaleiro, previously on the books at Fulham, had asked not to be considered because he has struggled with injury at French club Lille this season. Angola will compete in Group D at the Cup of Nations finals, starting against Algeria in Bouake on Jan. before they take on Mauritania and Burkina Faso.

A soccer player and Belgian club Royal Antwerp challenged European governing body UEFA's rules and those of the Belgian football association that require a minimum number of \"homegrown players\" to be included in the teams. Royal Antwerp FC had argued that the rules hamper a professional club from recruiting and fielding players who do not meet the requirement of local or national roots, violating both EU competition and free movement of workers rules. The court said the \"homegrown player\" rules might indeed give rise to \"indirect discrimination\", based on nationality against players coming from other member states. But it said it was still possible for UEFA and national associations to demonstrate that \"those rules nevertheless encourage recruitment and training, and that they are proportionate to that objective\", the court added. It said it was now up to the Belgian court handling the case to decide.",

      "article_body": "MANCHESTER, England, Dec Reuters UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin mocked the \"fantastic\" Super League on Thursday, hours after the European Court of Justice ruled that UEFA and FIFA contravened EU law by preventing the league's formation. The EU court said UEFA and FIFA had used their dominant position by threatening sanctions against the clubs that proposed forming the breakaway European league which led to nine of them withdrawing. Juventus pulled out later, leaving Real Madrid and Barcelona as the only supporters of the Super League. \"We will not try to stop them. They can create whatever they want,\" Ceferin told a virtual press conference. \"I hope they start their fantastic competition as soon as possible, with two clubs. \"I hope they know what they are doing but I'm not so sure about that. Football is not for sale, we have shown that many times,\" Ceferin added. \"We see the decision as a chance to improve some of the regulations. But football remains united, the evidence you see all of us stakeholders speaking today at the press conference. We have national governments and institutions behind us.\" Ceferin was joined on the call by senior officials including Nasser AlKhelaifi, President of Paris St Germain and the European Club Association, LaLiga President Javier Tebas and European Leagues President Pedro Proenca. \"There is a stark contrast between the ECJ's press summary and the ruling itself,\" Ceferin said. \"The judgement is actually positive as it embraces the key features of the European football pyramid open competitions, sporting merit, and solidarity. \"And you have in this press conference its governing body and all recognised stakeholders.\" Ceferin pointed out that Thursday's ruling does not give the green light nor approve projects such as the \"socalled Super League\" as the court did not rule on it specifically. \"They see it as a victory but I don't see it at all,\" AlKhelaifi said. \"The ruling has nothing to do with the Super League. All the stakeholders in Europe are sticking together with the same goal... The ruling will just make us better and stronger.\" AlKhelaifi also raised questions about A, the sports development company which was formed to help set up the Super League. A on Thursday proposed a new competition with men's and women's teams playing midweek matches in a league system across Europe. \"Who's A That's my question to you, who is A\" he said. \"Where do they come from What is their history\" AlKhelaifi described the Champions League, which was formed in , as the \"best club competition in the world\". \"The music itself is a brand, right So you have a brand that already exists for years and years,\" he said. \"Why someone will not be part of it We are as the clubs proud to be part of it. The dream even to hear the music, it's a dream, an amazing feeling.\"",

Parteys omission comes as Ghana coach Chris Hughton said he had been given more time to recover from a hamstring injury. Withstanding his injury, he certainly would be in the squad. We know the quality of player that he is. This is a player that has a substantial injury, Hughton told a press conference on Monday. Ive spent a lot over this period of time with Thomas and also engaging with the medical staff at Arsenal. This is the biggest injury that hes had.

Fans from both teams paid tribute to Luton's Tom Lockyer, who suffered a cardiac arrest in his side's last game against Bournemouth. With Newcastle fans unfurling a banner sending good wishes to the Luton defender before kickoff, supporters applauded as the advertising hoardings around the ground displayed the names of all those who helped Lockyer in his recovery. Newcastle wasted a golden chance to break the deadlock in the th minute as Anthony Gordon put in a brilliant cross for Callum Wilson, but the striker headed the ball straight at Thomas Kaminsiki. Townsend, who played for Newcastle in the season, put his side in front in the th minute by heading home Ross Barkley's flickon from a corner before running to the bench and grabbing one of Lockyer's number four shirts to celebrate. Barkley almost netted a second eight minutes later, unleashing a powerful shot that hit the underside of the crossbar as Newcastle's defence struggled to contain the home side. Alexander Isak thought he had equalised for Newcastle in the st minute when he slotted home from Miguel Almiron's pass, but he was flagged offside and a VAR review confirmed the original decision to disallow the goal. Though they remained dangerous on the break, Luton were forced to defend for much of the rest of the game as they hung on for a win that left them in th spot on points after games, Newcastle dropped to seventh on points. Luton's third win and first clean sheet of the campaign was dwarfed by the tributes to Lockyer and the tension of game. \"I'm an emotional wreck at the moment. I've just said to the lads I'm very, very proud of everybody,\" Luton coach Rob Edwards told the BBC. \"It's been a tough week for the football club, it's been the greatest challenge of my professional career it's funny, no coaching badges or anything prepare you for handling anything like this.\" Newcastle manager Eddie Howe could not hide his disappointment. \"We were well aware we were below our levels ... the second half was much better, but we could not force the goal we needed, and that mistake has cost us the match,\" he added.",

      "article_body": "MANCHESTER, England, Dec Reuters Liverpool moved back to the top of the Premier League with a victory at struggling Burnley on Tuesday as Manchester United gave their fans some Boxing Day cheer by rallying to beat Aston Villa . There was little festive joy for Newcastle United though as they suffered a surprise home defeat by Nottingham Forest for whom Chris Wood scored a hattrick. Luton Town won the day's big relegation battle beating Sheffield United thanks to two own goals while formteam Bournemouth won again to reach the top half of the table. Liverpool have now won all six of their Premier League games on Boxing Day under Juergen Klopp and while three points always looked likely against Burnley, it was not until substitute Diogo Jota's thminute goal that the points were sealed. Darwin Nunez's precision finish after six minutes gave Liverpool a flying start his first Premier League goal for almost two months. Liverpool had goals by Cody Gakpo and Harvey Elliott ruled out after VAR checks and Mohamed Salah rattled the crossbar as the visitors dominated. But thplaced Burnley rallied in the second half and there was a sense of relief for Klopp when a sweeping move ended with Jota slotting in from a tight angle late on. Liverpool overtook Arsenal to move into first place with points from games. Arsenal are on ahead of their London derby with West Ham United on Thursday. \"Whatever the outside world thinks, it is really intense and coming here and playing the game we played is absolutely exceptional,\" Klopp told reporters. \"It's exceptional as well that we didn't score more goals... actually, we did but for different reasons they took them away.\" On hitting the top, Klopp said \" points, that's really pleasing, to be honest. That's really cool because the first part of the season is done and it was absolutely alright what we did. Not perfect but it was alright.\" Manchester United turned halftime boos into a fulltime ovation at Old Trafford as they came back from two goals down to hand thirdplaced Villa their first loss in games in all competitions. Alejandro Garnacho scored a brace to cancel out firsthalf goals from John McGinn and Leander Dendoncker before Rasmus Hojlund clinched the winner with his first Premier League goal in the nd minute. \"I said it before the game, I said it during halftime, keep believing and we will win this game,\" said United manager Erik ten Hag, whose team moved up to sixth place. Newcastle's punishing schedule and injury list appears to be coming home to roost as they lost for the fifth time in seven games in all competitions. Wood only managed five Premier League goals for Newcastle during his time on Tyneside but returned to haunt his old club and secure a huge three points for Forest. Forest's first win under new coach Nuno Espirito Santo lifted them to th in the standings on points, five above the relegation zone, while Newcastle's fourth defeat in their last five league games left them eighth on points. Newcastle took the lead in the rd minute when Alexander Isak stroked home a penalty he had earned. Wood, who was loaned to Forest by Newcastle in January before being signed permanently, levelled just before the break with a closerange tapin from Anthony Elanga's pass. A counterattack in the rd minute ended with Wood dinking a superb finish over Martin Dubravka. The New Zealand international completed his hattrick on the hour mark when he rounded Dubravka and slotted home. In the basement battle Jack Robinson and Anis Ben Slimane scored own goals in the final minutes as Sheffield United let a late lead slip to lose at Luton, who are now just one point behind thplaced Everton. Alfie Doughty had given Luton the lead but goals by Oli McBurnie and Anel Ahmedhodzic turned the game on its head. But Robinson flicked a cross into his own net and Slimane deflected a shot past his goalkeeper. Bournemouth moved into the top half as goals by Justin Kluivert, Dominic Solanke and Luis Sinisterra earned them a victory over Fulham.",

      "article_body": "LIVERPOOL, England, Dec Reuters Liverpool missed out on reclaiming top spot when they were held to a draw by Manchester United at Anfield in the Premier League on Sunday, ending their perfect home record this season. Juergen Klopp's side had been knocked out of first place by Arsenal earlier on Sunday and would have recaptured a place at the summit with a win but lacked their usual goal threat. A United side shorn of confidence after a miserable week held on grimly for their point although they have now scored just once in their last eight league visits to Liverpool. The closest the hosts came to scoring was a Trent AlexanderArnold shot narrowly wide midway through the second half, while Danish forward Rasmus Hojlund had United's best chance. The visitors finished with men after Diogo Dalot was sent off in stoppage time for two yellow cards both for dissent. Secondplaced Liverpool have points from games with leaders Arsenal on , while United are seventh with . Liverpool partly opened their newly revamped Anfield Road Stand for the first time, bumping up the attendance to , the largest for years at their stadium. They were expected to make it home wins out of in all competitions but the intercity derby, traditionally one of the most feisty in England, failed to really ignite as they never looked like repeating the rout of last season. While United's performance was hardly one to celebrate, it at least showed some spirit after last week's loss to Bournemouth and a meek defeat by Bayern Munich in midweek that sent them crashing out of Europe. \"We're disappointed we couldn't make it more of a game and create more opportunities,\" Scott McTominay, United's captain in the absence of the suspended Bruno Fernandes, told Sky Sports. \"The boys will be pleased not to lose but also definitely not happy we didn't win.\" Klopp said Liverpool had dominated more than in last season's and the statistics showed they had goal attempts to the six of United. But the end product was missing. \"We tried everything and the numbers we created in terms of shots is crazy,\" Klopp said. \"But with that amount of shots they should be a few more on target. That was our fault today and we go from here.\" The atmosphere was muted in a tepid first half in which Liverpool began brightly but failed to exert sustained pressure on a United side many thought were there for the taking. United withstood the fast start by Liverpool and looked reasonably comfortable despite goal attempts by the hosts in the first half. Virgil van Dijk's header from a corner forced United goalkeeper Andre Onana into a smart save while Liverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch had a volley deflected wide. Klopp made a switch on the hour, bringing in Joe Gomez and pushing AlexanderArnold further forward, and it almost reaped rewards when the latter grazed the post with a low shot. United managed only one shot on target when, in a rare piece of fluent attacking play, Hojlund played a onetwo with McTominay but his angled shot was blocked by keeper Allison. In a breathless spell Onana then had to dive theatrically to push away a shot by Mo Salah. Liverpool pressed hard late and United survived a scare as a ball struck the arm of Luke Shaw in the area but a penalty was rightly not awarded.",

      "article_body": "BRIGHTON, England, Dec Reuters Brighton Hove Albion moved into eighth place in the Premier League with a mauling of Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday to end a superb year under Italian manager Roberto De Zerbi. The southcoast club may not have the spending power of the teams around them, and regularly sell key players to their rivals, but they have continued on an upward trajectory after qualifying for Europe for the first time last season. After his side's first win in four Premier League games, De Zerbi, now one of the most respected coaches in Europe, was at pains to point out the size of the club's achievements. \"I am really lucky to be this coach of this team with these players. I am very pleased with the passion they have, they have everything,\" he said. \"You can't forget we are Brighton. Sometimes they forget we are Brighton. We are not Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle or Arsenal, we are still Brighton. \"The other eight or nine big teams in the Premier League they do not sell their big players.\" Brighton sold Moises Caicedo to Chelsea and World Cupwinning midfielder Alexis Mac Allister to Liverpool in the close season while goalkeeper Robert Sanchez also joined Chelsea. But they continually find highquality replacements including Joao Pedro who scored two penalties on Thursday. The exWatford player was man of the match against Tottenham as Brighton made light of a lengthy injury list to run riot against the Londoners and lead before being pegged back. \"His performance was incredible and he played a great game. He played with incredible quality and attacked the space every time. I am happy for him,\" De Zerbi said of the Brazilian. De Zerbi added that his team had played fantastic football against Tottenham but suffered in the closing stages. \"We have to accept the last minutes. We suffered because Tottenham are one of the best in the Premier League,\" he said. \"We were leading but after the first goal back we accepted this from Tottenham. We felt like a lion and for that I am happy with the first minutes and for the last minutes as well.\"",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Liverpool are looking at the League Cup quarterfinal against West Ham United as an opportunity to develop their newlyassembled squad into a team that can compete on multiple fronts, assistant manager Pep Lijnders said on Monday. Liverpool have won the League Cup a record nine times, with their most recent win coming in the campaign when they also lifted the FA Cup, finished second in the Premier League and lost the Champions League final to Real Madrid. The Anfield club has since lost key players that helped them lift silverware, starting this campaign with an entirely new midfield featuring closeseason signings Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo and Ryan Gravenberch. \"We always say the first half of the season is the base that you create,\" Lijnders told reporters ahead of Wednesday's match at Anfield. \"That is why I like this competition a lot because it gives some players, young players, an opportunity and at the same time, you play early finals. And everybody knows that Liverpool football club is here to play finals. \"We start the season wanting to create new memories, special games, a team that can beat the best teams in the world. \"Especially with this team, because it's a new team, you want to play finals and reaching a semifinal in January would only be helpful for the boys to grow.\" Liverpool have been handed an injury boost, with Lijnders confirming that the injured trio of Gravenberch, Mac Allister and Diogo Jota were progressing well in their recovery and would soon be available for selection. Gravenberch was forced off the pitch in Liverpool's draw with Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday due to muscle fatigue. \"He can hopefully train today and we have to judge it and he has to judge himself,\" Ljinders said. \"I can't see why he wouldn't be available for the next week. \"Jota is outside doing ball work so he is getting better and better. With hamstrings it is always tricky and you always want to give it two or three days more because then you are sure. We will be careful with him but he is close. \"Mac Allister's injury will go into the new year but that could be possible and we play Jan. so let's see.\"",

The Iranian embassy in Madrid announced his release on New Year's Eve and he touched down at Madrid's Barajas Airport at around p.m. GMT on Tuesday. \"It has been very long, very hard but I am here in my country,\" a jubilant Sanchez told reporters at the airport after an emotional reunion with his family and friends. \"We are not aware of how fortunate we are to have been born here in this country,\" he added, referring to Spain. He called Spain's ambassador to Iran, Angel Losada \"a real phenomenon and master of negotiation.\" But as he addressed Losada in his remarks, he said \"I will probably go back to Iran, even if you told me not to.\" He said he wanted the Iranian authorities \"to understand that you cannot say no, that you have to let people free. If you put a fence in front of me I'm going to jump over it.\" Sanchez was last heard of on Oct. , , when he sent friends a picture of himself on the IraqIran border with the caption \"Entry to Iran\". His detention coincided with the biggest protests in Iran's history following Amini's death. Iran's embassy in Spain said his release took place \"within the framework of friendly and historical relations between the two countries and in compliance with the laws of Iran.\" Sanchez's mother, Celia Cogedor, spoke of relief as she waited for his arrival. \"The nightmare has ended at last,\" she told reporters at the airport. \"The worst were the first months after his disappearance because nobody knew if he was alive or dead.\"",

      "article_body": "LIVERPOOL, England, Dec Reuters Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta described Arsenal's draw with Liverpool as one of the most intense games in decades on Saturday as the north Londoners' long wait for a league victory at Anfield continued. Gabriel's early headed goal gave Arsenal hope of a first league win at Liverpool since but Mohammed Salah struck a superb equaliser before halftime. Arteta's side finished strongly but could not force a winner, although they will head into Christmas with a onepoint lead over Liverpool and Aston Villa at the top of the table. The Spaniard said ahead of the clash that playing at Anfield was like being in a washing machine and he was not to be disappointed in a highoctane duel. \"An unbelievable game of football, one of the most intense I've witnessed in years in this league,\" Arteta said. \"For many moments we were on top, in the last minutes we wanted it more, but a draw is a fair result. \"To see our boys have the courage and belief to play like we have done here I think our players deserve big, big credit.\" Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp was effusive in his praise for Arsenal, while Arteta said Liverpool caused chaos. \"We were determined to attack and cause them problems. They are a team who cause chaos, they are so vertical and direct. They are the best in the world at doing that,\" Arteta said. \"It was an unbelievable game of football with two teams that raised the bar to another level.\" Arsenal will spend Christmas Day top for the second successive season, although they may have been knocked off their perch before they play again on Thursday. Liverpool and Aston Villa, who are one point behind, are both in action on Tuesday. \"I'm happy to be where we are. Tomorrow we have a beautiful dinner with our families, then back to work,\" Arteta said. While Arsenal have won five of their last seven league games, Arteta said they still need to improve if they are to stay ahead in a tight title battle. \"Yeah of course there are certain things that we have to improve. Especially killing games,\" he said. \"Sometimes the results have been too close. But we have showed a good level with five key players out. That's something we have to maintain.\" Liverpool counted the cost of their point with left back Kostas Tsimikas suffering a suspected broken collarbone, while Klopp was also left frustrated about his side not being awarded a penalty for an apparent handball by Martin Odegaard. \"I am pretty sure someone will come to explain it to me why it was not a handball but I don't know how,\" Klopp said. \"I don't say that the ref can see it because I don't know where he was in that moment. But how can a guy in an office see that and not come to the conclusion that maybe, possibly it could be worth the referee having another look\"",

      "article_body": "LUTON, England, Dec Reuters Chelsea survived a late Luton Town fightback to return to winning ways on the road with a win at Kenilworth Road on Saturday, with Cole Palmer netting twice either side of a fine Noni Madueke strike. The expensively assembled Blues had lost their previous four Premier League away games but looked certain to claim all three points when they were up against relegationthreatened Luton with little more than minutes of normal time remaining. Palmer put the Blues ahead in the th minute when he pounced on an error by Luton defender Issa Kabore to unleash a fierce angled shot that flew past Thomas Kaminski. Palmer was at the heart of Chelsea's second goal in the th minute when he was found by leftback Levi Colwill on the break, and the former Manchester City man teed up Madueke, who created just enough space to fire high into Kaminski's net. It was the second goal in two games for the winger who came on as a substitute on Wednesday against Crystal Palace to score a late winner from the penalty spot in a victory for Chelsea. In the th minute, the visitors seemed to have dealt Luton a final blow when Nicolas Jackson split the home defence to find Palmer, who kept his cool to round Kaminski and hold off a gaggle of defenders to make it to the visitors. Former Chelsea midfielder Ross Barkley scored what looked like a consolation goal for the hosts when he headed in from an Alfie Doughty corner in the th minute. Seven minutes later Elijah Adebayo reduced the deficit to just one goal, but Luton failed to get an equaliser despite almost incessant pressure in the dying moments, roared on by their fans in their small stadium. \"For us, at the game looks over but in the Premier League it is never over,\" Chelsea coach Mauricio Pochettino told the BBC. \"We need to show more capacity to manage this type of situation. When you have something in your hands you don't want to lose it and you go deeper.\" Luton coach Rob Edwards hailed his players for not giving up and almost securing a point against their more illustrious rivals. \"They were hanging on. We can take a lot from that and the performances have been good,\" Edwards told TNT Sports. \"Maybe we are changing the narrative around us perhaps a little bit, and people are seeing it a bit more.\" The win left Chelsea in th place while Luton remain in the relegation zone in th spot.",

Trippier's mistake led to Chelsea's addedtime equaliser and he missed a penalty in the shootout as Newcastle exited the competition a week after going out of the Champions League. \"Kieran Trippier is fine, he is a strong character and vastly experienced. As well, it is not about one individual it is about the collective,\" Howe told reporters on Friday ahead of Saturday's Premier League game at Luton Town. \"Being one of the leaders in the group, Trippier is a strong character and team mates will look to him, but I don't think it has been any different.\" Luton, th in the table, will not be an easy place for sixthplaced Newcastle to end their sixmatch away winless streak in all competitions, Howe said. \"I know full well that it is a difficult place to go, as I have been there many times as a player,\" he added. \"They ran Manchester City very close, they couldn't have gone any closer against Arsenal, in the way that match seesawed, and got a really good draw against Liverpool.\" Howe is also dealing with an . \"It was a horrible challenge,\" Howe said about Moises Caicedo's tackle on Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon during the Chelsea game. \"He is sore but we will see how he is today. \"Emil Krafth had a nasty cut on his shin which went deep, so it required stitches.\" Howe said he was yet to make a decision on the availability of Fabian Schar, Joelinton and Alekander Isak, but was happy with the recovery of Sven Botman who played the first half on Tuesday. \"Sven is good, we will assess him today... he has looked strong and comfortable,\" the manager said. Howe also sent his best wishes to Luton captain Tom Lockyer who suffered a cardiac arrest during the game at Bournemouth last weekend. \"It puts football into perspective,\" Howe said. \"Luton fans will be thinking of Tom and the whole buildup will be reflective of that, but for us we just have to concentrate on our performance. \"We have all been in these positions before and we need a response against Luton.\"",

Rovers are rd in the league standings after games and in danger of being relegated to the fifthtier National League, which is largely semiprofessional. Horseman was sacked after Tuesday's FA Cup secondround loss at Blackpool. Deeney, who spent the majority of his playing career at Watford and led them to Premier League promotion twice, joined Rovers as a playercoach earlier this season from Birmingham City. \"I know the fans will have many questions, which will be answered as soon as possible. We will not hide from the task at hand and will be open and honest along the way,\" Deeney said in a statement. \"One thing I can assure everyone is that we will work our very hardest to bring this wonderful club back to success. \"This is an exciting new role with many challenges that I'll embrace and there's a lot of work for us to do, which has already started.\" Deeney's first game in charge will be at home against Gillingham on Friday.",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Manchester City have not had the ideal start in their bid for an unprecedented fourth straight Premier League trophy but manager Pep Guardiola said on Friday that they were up for the challenge with rich experience from their previous title runs. City are fourth in the standings with a game in hand after just two wins in their last seven matches. They trail league leaders Liverpool by five points. Guardiola's side have also failed to keep a clean sheet since October and the Spaniard said teams in the bottom half of the table have closed the gap to the heavyweights this season. \"The lower teams in the bottom are getting points and results against the top teams. In the last few seasons, it didn't happen much, but the top teams are struggling to get the results,\" Guardiola told reporters. \"So never give up, keep going and go game by game. We are used to it in the last seasons, we just need to be calm, analyse it. \"The Premier League is so long, there are many, many things. With Man City, many things are going to happen.\" City face bottom side Sheffield United on Saturday, a team they have beaten in all six Premier League meetings. But Erling Haaland is still unavailable along with Kevin De Bruyne, Jeremy Doku and John Stones. Haaland, the league's top scorer with goals, has not played since the start of December and has missed City's last six games in all competitions. \"Nothing has changed from the last games. The same are injured, plus John Stones,\" Guardiola said. City finish with five trophies having won the FIFA Club World Cup earlier this month to add to their treble from last season and the UEFA Super Cup in August, but Guardiola said the year could still have been better. \"Not bad at all. Could be better, always can be better. Don't be greedy too much,\" he said. \"When we lose a game, we are out of the title race. When we win a game, we are there. It's the same for our contenders. \"Everything can happen, maybe the results we cannot expect. The last game of the year and then in January it's more relaxed and we have more days for recovery.\"",

Hajime Moriyasu included the yearold in a man squad that also features Liverpool's Wataru Endo, Arsenal defender Takehiro Tomiyasu and Takefusa Kubo of Real Sociedad for the competition, which kicks off on Jan. . \"I don't know if Mitoma will be ready for the first match, but he is recovering well and I expect him to be available at an early stage,\" Moriyasu told reporters. Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi had cast doubt on Mitoma's availability for the nation continental championship, which runs until Feb. , after he limped off during a draw with Crystal Palace on Dec. . Japan are aiming to win the Asian Cup for a recordextending fifth time having previously landed the title in , , and . Moriyasu led the Samurai Blue to the final in , where his side lost to Qatar. Celtic striker Kyogo Furuhashi was among those to miss out on selection alongside Lazio's Daichi Kamada and Fortuna Dusseldorf midfielder Ao Tanaka. The exclusion of Tanaka, who famously scored the winner for Japan against Spain at the World Cup, came as a surprise after the yearold had been on target for Moriyasu's side in a friendly win over Thailand in Tokyo on Monday. The Samurai Blue will kick off their Asian Cup challenge on Jan. against Vietnam, who are led by former Japan coach Philippe Troussier, before taking on Iraq and Indonesia in Group D.",

      "article_body": "Jan Reuters The Serie A season reaches the midway point this weekend and while no trophy is up for grabs just yet either Inter Milan or Juventus can claim the title of winter champions. \"Campione d'Inverno\" is the unofficial title given to the side leading Serie A at the season's halfway point and can be a good indicator of who will win the Scudetto, with out of winter champions going on to lift the league title. Inter's draw at Genoa last weekend allowed Juve to close the gap on the leaders with a home win over AS Roma, and just two points now separate the sides as their impressive form has turned the campaign into a twohorse race. They each now face teams struggling at the other end of the table with their opponents having played each other last weekend. Inter host Hellas Verona on Saturday while Juventus travel to Salernitana on Sunday. Bottom side Salernitana got their second league win of the season with a success at Verona last time out and are two points off Verona, who are th and one spot above the drop zone. Simone Inzaghi's Inter have won their last four home league games, but did suffer their only Serie A loss this season at San Siro, to Sassuolo in September, while Verona pushed Juve when they went to Turin in October, losing to a th minute goal. It would still be a major shock though if points were dropped this time by an Inter a side with more than double the goal difference of Juventus after having conceded only eight times in games and scoring . Juve are also impressive in defence with goals conceded, but the they have scored shows they are happy to earn narrow victories and manager Massimiliano Allegri will have no complaints if another close game brings his side three points. The last time Inter held top spot at the midway point was in but AC Milan went on to win the league, reversing the previous season's events when Inter won the Scudetto despite Milan leading halfway through. Juventus won nine consecutive league titles before that and were crowned winter champions in seven out of those nine seasons. Whoever is top after this weekend, the title race is sure to remain a battle of wits until the end of the campaign. Milan gave underpressure manager Stefano Pioli some relief with a win over Sassuolo last weekend and travel on Sunday to secondbottom Empoli, who are without a win for six games. Pioli's side are third, nine points adrift of Inter, seven points off Juve and three points ahead of Fiorentina in fourth. Since their defeat by Milan in November, Fiore have won four games in a five match unbeaten run, conceding just once. Vincenzo Italiano's side are at Sassuolo on Saturday, while fifthplaced Bologna look to bounce back from a shock defeat at Udinese when they host Genoa on Friday. AS Roma are seventh and a point behind Atalanta who they host at Stadio Olimpico on Sunday when defending champions Napoli, in eighth spot level on points with Roma, visit Torino.",

He came off the bench to score a second half hattrick in the Socceroos' World Cup qualifier against Bangladesh just over a month ago. \"My last game for the national team was a hattrick but I know my position under Arnie Arnold, and its not a starter and I have to accept that,\" said the yearold.

      "article_body": "JEDDAH, Dec Reuters Jhon Arias and John Kennedy scored in the second half to give Brazilian side Fluminense a hardfought win over Egypt's AlAhly in their Club World Cup semifinal at King Abdullah Sports City on Monday. The Copa Libertadores champions will face the winners of Manchester City's semifinal against Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds on Tuesday in Friday's final in Jeddah. It was a compelling encounter, with an aggressive Fluminense dominating possession, but often being exposed by AlAhly's counter attacks. Colombia winger Arias was a constant menace, running up and down the right channel and hitting the post twice in the first half. However, Africa's champions AlAhly wasted several opportunities, using the speed of Kahraba and Percy Tau to launch quick counters. Kahraba was denied from two clearcut early chances, first by Samuel Xavier who made a heroic goalline clearance in the th minute, while goalkeeper Fabio made a brilliant onehanded save to palm round the post a closerange header right before the break. Coached by Brazil caretaker manager Fernando Diniz, Fluminense got back on top in the second half but their goalkeeper Fabio made another critical save from a Tau counter. Fluminense finally managed to break the deadlock thanks to former Real Madrid fullback Marcelo, who nutmegged a defender, hitting the ball through his legs, to get into the box before being fouled from behind. Arias slotted the penalty just inside the right post and out of the reach of goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy in the st minute. \"I always try to do something different the nutmeg. I've always tried in my whole career,\" Marcelo told Brazilian TV Globo. \"At that moment, the game was in deadlock. I didn't even think about a nutmeg, it happened, I thought about dribbling to get inside the area. \"So I managed to get in front of him and he fouled me... It wasn't thought out, it came on the spot and it was nice.\" AlAhly had a chance to level one minute later, but Tau missed a sitter, heading into the goalkeeper's hands from pointblank range. As AlAhly tried to push for the equaliser, they were left exposed and Fluminense took advantage with substitute Kennedy adding a second in the th minute with a strike to finish off a counter attack.",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters The wave of fans' resistance was so ferocious the last time the European Super League reared its head that the six English Premier League clubs involved quickly jumped ship, effectively stopping the project in its tracks. So although Thursday's European Court of Justice ruling against European soccer governing body UEFA was celebrated by those still seeking to make the plan a reality, namely Barcelona and Real Madrid, fan power could once again be their biggest hurdle. When the European Super League was launched like a bolt out of the blue in April , clubs initially signed up with three more expected to form a \"founding \" for whom relegation would be impossible. Five more clubs would have had the chance to join annually based on domestic performances. It went against the ethos of meritocracy that remains the bedrock belief of the vast majority of soccer fans and whose anger, particularly in England where the club pyramid system is cherished, quickly manifested itself in protests. Stung by the outrage, Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur beat hasty retreats and within hours of its launch, the ESL project lay in tatters. Even after the threat diminished, anger boiled over when United's game against Liverpool in May was abandoned after a stadium and pitch invasion in protest at United owner Joel Glazer and his role in the club's ESL flirtation. The push back proved so strong that a FanLed Review was commissioned within days and last month the recommendations of that, including for an independent regulator, formed part of the Football Governance Bill that will become law next year. Under the regulator, all English clubs will be forced to have a license which can be withdrawn if they attempt to join breakaway leagues. Hours after the European Court of Justice ruled that UEFA and world governing body FIFA had breached EU law by preventing clubs joining the ESL, a new project was outlined by A. The organisation's CEO Bernd Reichart said the team men's league would feature relegation and promotion and would be \"open, meritocratic and accessible\" and would set clubs free. He also dangled a carrot by saying the European Super League, a direct threat to UEFA's flagship Champions League, would be shown free on a fancentric streaming service. But despite the silky presentation, fan groups remain unimpressed and Manchester United, perhaps wary of antagonising their fanbase, quickly reaffirmed their support for UEFA competitions. \"Supporters, players and clubs have already made clear they don't want a stitchedup competition we all want to see the trigger pulled on the walking dead monstrosity that is the European Zombie League,\" Football Supporters Association chief executive Kevin Miles said in a statement. \"While the corpse might continue to twitch in the European courts, no English side will be joining. The incoming independent regulator will block any club from competing in domestic competition if they join a breakaway super league.\" Campaign group Fair Game said the European Super League was not in the wider interests of the sport. Reacting to A's proposals, a spokesman said \"The devil is in the details, but what is essential is that such a venture cannot ever be allowed to pass. \"It is now up to the incoming independent regulator to put the final nail in the coffin of the European Super League.\" In a statement the Premier League said it rejected the concept of a European Super League \"Supporters are of vital importance to the game and they have time and again made clear their opposition to a breakaway competition,\" it said.",

There is a lot of work ahead of us, and I am eager to get onto the training ground to start working with the players. \"We will work together as we aim to bring success to the club. The hard work begins now.\" Kewell becomes the third Australian coach in a row to take charge of the club, following in the footsteps of Ange Postecoglou and Muscat.

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Tottenham Hotspur ended Evertons excellent Premier League run with a typically entertaining, high riskreward home victory on Saturday that capped their own impressive December and took them back into the top four. Goals by Richarlison and Son Heungmin had Spurs up inside minutes but things are never straightforward for the home side and, as Everton took command in the second half, they ended up hanging on desperately when Andre Gomes made it eight minutes from time. They did so, just, to secure their third win in a row following a fivegame winless run that lifted them above champions Manchester City into fourth place. Everton will wonder how they got nothing from the game after dominating the second half and continue to hover just above the relegation zone thanks to their point deduction. They had come into the match on a run of four successive league wins, without a goal conceded, but all too aware of their dire form against Spurs in recent years, having won only one of their last meetings, drawing . That sturdy rearguard was soon punctured twice as Spurs put together a series of slick attacks. A low cross by Brennan Johnson was neatly swept in by former Evertonian Richarlison after nine minutes for his fourth goal in three games, having managed two in the previous . It was the first Everton had conceded since losing to Manchester United in November but nine minutes later they were undone again when Johnsons shot was parried by Jordan Pickford straight to Son, who bundled it back past the England keeper. Spurs, sticking relentlessly to the Ange Postecoglou playbook, showed remarkable skill and poise to play the ball out of their own box with intricate passing patterns. However, it was not without danger and Everton nicked the ball back too frequently for the nervous home fans. Having engineered promising positions, though, Dominic CalvertLewin, James Garner and Jack Harrison all finished tamely, allowing Guglielmo Vicario to make comfortable saves. CalvertLewin finally found the net five minutes into the second half, only for the goal to be ruled out by VAR for a foul on Emerson Royal. Garner brushed a post with a crisp shot as Everton continued to press and Tottenham refused to try to close the game down. Richarlison went off, feeling his back, and there was a nice touch as he applauded the Everton fans, who returned the compliment to a player whose goals saved them from relegation two seasons ago. Everton continued to press and Gomes, in his first appearance since May , lashed in a great low shot to make it after minutes before a brilliant save by Vicario prevented Arnaut Danjuma levelling. Everton piled forward relentlessly and, almost comically, so did Spurs in a relentless finale, but the home side held out. \"We went through that difficult spell where we got ourselves in front but didn't end up putting the game to bed. In the context of everything we're going through with the squad, it's a big three points,\" Postecoglou said. \"We started taking too many touches on the ball and slowing the game down which played into their hands. We had to show resilience in the second half to get a result.\" Everton manager Sean Dyche was frustrated by the disallowed goal decision, but as upbeat as any manager could be after a defeat. \"That was one of the performances I'm most proud of superb,\" he said. \"The way we played, asking questions. Bizarrely, we come away with nothing but that was an outstanding performance. The level of performance today was absolutely excellent.\"",

      "article_body": "ISTANBUL, Dec Reuters The Turkish Super Cup final between Galatasaray and Fenerbahce scheduled to be played in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh on Friday was postponed over what the clubs described as \"some problems\" in the event's organisation. At the heart of those issues, according to media reports, was the wish of the two Istanbul teams to wear Tshirts featuring the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, during the warmup ahead of the evening kickoff. Turkish media said Saudi officials had rejected this demand, though it was not clear why, and that the clubs refused to play in the Super Cup final at the King Saud University venue, which is also known as AlAwwal Park stadium, as a result. Saudi state TV cited a statement by organisers the Riyadh Season saying the cancellation of the final was the result of the teams not adhering to match regulations. \"We were looking forward to holding the match on time in accordance with the international soccer rules and regulations that require the sport to be presented without any slogans outside its scope, especially since this was discussed with the Turkish Football Federation in the framework of the preparatory meetings for the match,\" the statement said. \"Despite this agreement, it was unfortunate that the two teams did not adhere to what had been agreed upon, which led to the match not being held,\" it added. The scheduled final coincides with the th anniversary of the foundation of the secular Turkish Republic. There was no immediate comment from Saudi officials. \"We want Turkish sports, and soccer in particular, to be on the agenda not with discussions, but with achievements,\" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday at an award ceremony in Istanbul. \"For whatever reason, turning sports into an appetiser for daily political rivalry is wrong, misguided and does not do our sports any good,\" he added. \"The Super Cup ... has been postponed to a later date as a result of a joint decision we made with our clubs, due to some problems in its organisation,\" the two teams and the Turkish Football Federation TFF said on X. It was not clear where or when the final would be staged. The joint statement thanked Saudi Arabia's football federation and authorities for efforts they made to organise the event. There had also been media reports that Turkey's national anthem and flag would not be allowed at the final but the TFF earlier said they would feature. The teams received a warm welcome on their return to Istanbul after the final was postponed, Turkish media reported on Saturday. Photographs and video footage showed hundreds of Galatasaray and Fenerbahce fans cheering loudly and waving Turkish flags, carrying pictures of modern Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk at Istanbul and Sabiha Gokcen airports. The incident came amid a recent warming of relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan amid efforts to repair ties that were ruptured after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in . The cancellation of the final added to what has been a controversyfilled month for Turkish soccer. The president of toptier club Ankaragucu, Faruk Koca, was arrested on Dec. for in the face at the end of a match. The TFF on Koca and also sanctioned Ankaragucu.

Milan manager Stefano Pioli fielded a depleted back line, with Fikayo Tomori, Malick Thiaw and Pierre Kalulu all sidelined due to injuries. \"We can play and create even more but I think we had the right approach today. I am happy with the way we played and suffered together and how we won this game,\" Pioli told DAZN. \"This is the teams victory. This is a group that, during my time here, has never given up in difficult moments.\" The hosts had an early effort disallowed when Olivier Giroud was offside as he delivered a cross for Bennacer to slot home. Another Milan attempt on goal was disallowed as Rafael Leao's finish was cancelled out for offside in the buildup. Sassuolo had their best chance moments later when Domenico Berardi's curling shot required a diving save from keeper Mike Maignan who tipped it over the bar. The hosts sat back after Pulisic's goal, limiting Sassuolo to longrange attempts, and they comfortably held out for the win. Earlier on Saturday, Bologna's recent momentum was ended as they suffered a loss at Udinese. Thiago Motta's side, vying for a topfour spot, were left in fifth place, trailing Fiorentina in fourth by two points. Milan will start the New Year by hosting Cagliari in the Coppa Italia round of on Jan. . Bologna entertain Genoa in Serie A three days later.",

      "article_body": "BURNLEY, England, Dec Reuters Liverpool returned to the top of the Premier League as Darwin Nunez's first league goal for almost two months helped them to a victory at struggling Burnley on Tuesday. Nunez's precision finish after six minutes gave Liverpool a flying start at Turf Moor but Juergen Klopp's side were unable to kill off the hosts as the second goal would not come. Mohamed Salah was denied by the crossbar and both Cody Gakpo and Harvey Elliott had goals disallowed as Burnley hung on but Diogo Jota's thminute effort sealed the points. Nineteenthplaced Burnley had chances of their own in the second half and almost snatched an equaliser when Jacob Bruun Larsen's shot went agonisingly wide of the post. Liverpool's first win in three league games moved them above Arsenal as they reached the halfway point of the season on points. Arsenal, who have , host West Ham United on Thursday. There was a sense of relief when substitute Jota fired in from a tight angle for his th Liverpool goal after a sweeping move as the points should have long been in the bag. \"We put hurdles in front of us and eventually we find a way to get over them but it's unbelievable,\" Klopp told Amazon Prime. \"We played an incredible game but it was only and then they realised something was possible. \"They could have scored an equaliser that would have been insane and then with the most difficult situation in the whole game we made it .\" Liverpool, held to home draws by Manchester United and Arsenal in their last two games, totally dominated the opening stages and Nunez produced a silky finish to curl an effort inside goalkeeper James Trafford's post after Gakpo's setup. Salah should have made it after good work by Gakpo and Nunez but his shot was well saved by Trafford. Gakpo then had the ball in the net but his effort was disallowed for a foul in the buildup by Nunez. Burnley played some neat football, as is their style, but lived dangerously as Salah rattled the crossbar with a dipping drive after being played in by Joe Gomez. The pattern continued after the break and Elliott produced a sharp finish but VAR again came to Burnley's rescue as referee Paul Tierney disallowed the goal for offside against Salah. That letoff inspired Burnley and they began to threaten an equaliser with Larsen giving Liverpool a big fright before Jota finally put the game to bed.",

West Ham took the lead against the run of play after minutes when Tomas Soucek netted after a pullback from Jarrod Bowen who was deemed to have just kept the ball in play. The VAR check took almost five minutes to complete due to Bowen's position in blocking the main camera angle and meant the onfield decision that the ball had stayed in remained. \"It is just a shame that with the technology that we have that it is not that clear that we can say yes that it's out or in,\" a disappointed Arteta told reporters. The Spaniard has had a number of runins with the football authorities this season following outbursts about VAR rulings. Earlier this month, he by the FA after branding the decision not to rule out Anthony Gordon's goal in the loss at Newcastle United on Nov. an embarrassment and a disgrace after the goal stood following three VAR checks. West Ham manager David Moyes said he had not seen all the replays yet but it was deflating for scoring teams when the VAR screen appears after a goal and the check takes a long time. The Scot added that his team \"defended fantastically well\" to secure the win after Konstantinos Mavropanos added a second in the th and he was relaxed about sealing a new contract. \"There is plenty of time to talk about that\" he said, adding that all parties were happy with West Ham's current trajectory. \"We can get that done when we are ready. I'm enjoying my time.\"",

      "article_body": "MADRID, Jan Reuters Spanish soccer star Jenni Hermoso testified in Madrid High Court on Tuesday over the kiss she said football federation chief Luis Rubiales planted on her lips without her consent after Spain's victory in the Women's World Cup last summer. Hermoso spent around hours speaking behind closed doors to investigating judge Francisco de Jorge, who is examining evidence including television footage before deciding whether to approve charges and advance the case to trial. She told reporters as she left the court accompanied by her lawyer \"All is in the hands of justice, that's all I can say... the process will take its course.\" The yearold Spain's alltime top scorer lodged a criminal complaint of sexual assault and coercion in September over the kiss on the winners' podium on Aug. , saying she had not wanted to be kissed, and that she felt \"vulnerable and a victim of an aggression\". Rubiales, who resigned as president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation RFEF on Sept. amid heavy pressure, after previously refusing to go, said the kiss was \"spontaneous, mutual, euphoric and consensual\". The case sent shock waves through the sporting world and society in Spain and abroad, prompting protests and further accusations by women that prominent or powerful men had forced intimacy on them. In Spain, the social media hashtag SeAcabo \"It's over\", became a rallying cry. As well as possible criminal charges, Rubiales an inquiry by Spain's top sport court over alleged \"serious misconduct\", and world soccer governing body FIFA has him from office for three years. In August, High Court prosecutor Marta Durantez Gil said the sexual assault charge that Rubiales might face carried a prison term of between one and four years. She said Hermoso had said in her complaint that she and her relatives were put under pressure by Rubiales and his entourage to say that she \"justified and approved what happened\". Judge Francisco de Jorge imposed a restraining order to prevent Rubiales from approaching Hermoso when he in midSeptember.",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters A seismic year for soccer in Saudi Arabia witnessed the turbocharging of its domestic league with expensive foreign superstars, an audacious bid to host the World Cup and the staging of FIFA's intercontinental club tournament. And will only be a few weeks old before Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo renew their iconic rivalry in Riyadh. Argentina's World Cup winning talisman Messi did not join the exodus to Saudi Arabia's Pro League SPL this year, but his Inter Miami team will face AlNassr, Ronaldo's club, in the socalled Riyadh Season Cup on Feb. . That match lacks the gravitas of the previous clashes between the two soccer icons. But it will once again thrust Saudi Arabia into the spotlight as the kingdom expands a sport portfolio already bulging with LIV Golf, boxing, tennis and F. When Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund PIF bought Premier League club Newcastle United in after a protracted process accompanied by cries of 'sports washing', it underlined the country's intent to follow the lead of the United Arab Emirates and Qatar its smaller neighbours who have bankrolled some of Europe's biggest soccer clubs. But Saudi Arabia wants to go further as part of its Vision project aimed at diversifying the kingdom's economy and glossing the country's global image. Developing a domestic soccer league that can become one of the top in world soccer is crucial and no expense is being spared in trying to make that a reality. PIF took control of four of Saudi Arabia's biggest clubs in June AlNassr, AlIttihad, AlAhli and AlHilal then spent huge amounts recruiting the likes of Neymar, Karim Benzema, Riyad Mahrez, Sadio Mane and N'Golo Kante, to name a few. Around one billion dollars of talent arrived in a headspinning summer and as the January window opens, fans of top clubs in Europe might well wonder who is next. Cynics might say such rapid growth from a lowprofile regional league to one capable of disrupting soccer's old order is doomed to failure, pointing to the Chinese Super League that sparkled briefly before fizzling out. But the Saudi approach endorsed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman looks built for the long haul, even if the initial splurge on player recruitment might slow down. \"I'm hoping it January is not very busy, because I think the job that was done has been quite interesting and aggressive, and most of the clubs, I believe, have what they need,\" Michael Emenalo, the SPL's director of football, said recently. Quality players still operating at their peak are the prime targets and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah and Paris St Germain's Kylian Mbappe will be on the shopping list. \"I think we will still see some acceleration over the next couple of transfer windows but then you will see a sort of tapering off and it becoming a more longterm strategy,\" Dan Plumley, a soccer finance expert at Sheffield Hallam University, told Reuters. \"The end goal is still a long way but the strategy is in place and they have some really smart people and experience working on it. And money will clearly not be an issue. Personally I think it will be sustained for the long term.\" Saudi Arabia, unlike World Cup hosts Qatar, has a strong soccer culture and little more than a year ago the Green Falcons beat eventual champions Argentina at the World Cup, sparking massive celebrations. While catapulting the Saudi Pro League to the top table of world soccer is one priority, investment in leading worldwide clubs and organisations is another. The rekindling of the European Super League project after this month's European Court of Justice ruling will not have gone unnoticed by Saudi Arabia who could view funding the ESL's lofty ambitions as another way to spread their influence. And with their World Cup bid, the only one received, almost certain to be ratified by FIFA next year, the Saudi bubble does not look like bursting anytime soon. . pounds",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters FIFA has temporarily suspended its new agent regulations FFAR worldwide until the European Court of Justice gives its decision following injunctions against implementing some of the new rules, world soccer's governing body said on Saturday. Agents have been at loggerheads with FIFA after they lost an appeal in July to block new regulations that would cap their transfer commissions and introduce exams that agents must pass to secure a licence. However, courts in Germany and Spain issued temporary injunctions against implementing some of the regulations in domestic transfers earlier this year. FIFA has initiated appeal proceedings against the injunction in Germany and a decision is expected early in . To comply with the injunction FIFA said it would suspend the implementation of FFAR for any transfer which has a link to the European Union. But it has made the suspension global to ensure a level playing field and avoid problems with international transfers to or from the continent. \"On December the Bureau of the Council approved the worldwide temporary suspension of the FFAR rules... until the European Court of Justice renders a final decision in the pending procedures concerning the FFAR,\" FIFA said in a circular to member associations. The midseason transfer window in Europe opens on Jan. . Earlier this month, an English FA tribunal also ruled that the proposed regulations were with British competition law. The tribunal was set up in June when agencies CAA Base, Wasserman, Stellar and ARETE challenged the implementation of FIFA's new regulations in the National Football Agent Regulations NFAR for English domestic transfers.",

      "article_body": "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia Dec Reuters Julian Alvarez scored the fastest ever goal in a Club World Cup final as Manchester City thrashed Brazilian side Fluminense on Friday to cap a remarkable year by capturing their fifth trophy of . Pep Guardiola's team, who were missing injured striker Erling Haaland at the global tournament, had already captured the FA Cup, Premier League, Champions League and UEFA Super Cup this year. The Spaniard hinted that his time at the club might be coming to an end when he said \"the job was done\" and \"there was nothing else to win\" after eight years at the helm. \"I have the feeling we've closed a chapter. We've already won all the titles,\" Guardiola told a news conference. \"There's nothing left to win. I have the feeling the job is done, is over.\" Guardiola, who arrived at City in , claimed his th title with the club. He added he wanted to write a new chapter with the team where he has months left on his contract. \"Now it's Christmas time, buy another book and start to write it again. The last eight years it's over,\" he said. \"When I close the chapter it's for eight years of incredible work behind the scenes. Today we celebrate on the plane, tomorrow rest. \"The players out there are still hungry and motivated. Its a beautiful, beautiful day.\" Captain Kyle Walker added \"To win these five trophies for me, the five biggest prizes available to us is incredible. \"I am so proud to have been a part of this and I can honestly say it's an honour to play alongside these players I couldn't ask for better team mates. \"Its really, really hard to win consistently, so to be sat here today having won the five titles is really special and a huge achievement.\" Alvarez had the travelling City fans cheering seconds after kick off. Keeper Fabio did well to push Nathan Ake's long shot off the post but Alvarez was quick to the rebound, stooping to his hands and knees to chest it home. Nino scored an own goal in the th minute, deflecting a shot from Phil Foden sideways into the net. Foden put the game away in the nd minute when he slid to poke in a hard cross across the box from Alvarez. \"It was an unbelievable match,\" Foden told FIFA.com. \"The lads showed not only quality, showed heart and determination. I'm delighted with the outcome. \"This is so important for the club,\" he added. \"I'm delighted. It is massive for the club.\" Alvarez completed his brace in the th with a strike from just inside the box, prompting delighted City fans to break into \"Blue Moon.\" The victory made Guardiola the first manager to guide three different clubs to Club World Cup titles, winning with Barcelona in and , then Bayern Munich in . Guardiola stressed to his players this week about the importance of \"closing the circle\" on the team's trophies, and achieving a \"onceinalifetime\" goal. Message received. City never allowed Fluminense, who play the quintessential Brazilian shortpassing possession style, to find their stride. \"Fair play to them, I love the way they play with short passes, they didn't make it easy for us,\" Foden said. The Brazilians' best chance would have been a penalty that referee Szymon Marciniak initially awarded after Ederson brought down Paulo Henrique Ganso. But technology showed he was offside. City keeper Ederson had little to do, but made a terrific save just before halftime when Jhon Arias met a corner with a thunderous header that Ederson dove across the net to push away. \"We faced a City which have been the best team in the world for the last five years and they know how to make the most of the opportunities they create,\" Fluminense manager Fernando Diniz told Brazilian TV Globo. \"They are always spot on, scored really early and they punished us for the mistakes we made. We have to be proud for our incredible year and to have paved the road that led us here. It was an amazing ride and there is nothing to be ashamed of.\" The one cloud on City's evening was an apparent knee injury to Rodri, who crumpled to the pitch when Alexsander caught him by the ankle. Rodri immediately grabbed the back of his knee. After receiving treatment, he briefly returned to the game before going down again and left the pitch in agony. Rodri was presented with the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, and was able to walk across the presentation stage to receive his trophy. City captain Kyle Walker claimed the Silver Ball. The tournament will feature an expanded team format in the United States.",

He explained to me that Ok, he played minutes but he wasnt ready to travel,\" Broos told a press conference as he named a man squad. \"There is still the danger that he could have the same problems he had two months ago.

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters The Premier League will serve up its traditional festive feast of action but few games will be as eagerlyanticipated as firstplaced Arsenal's trip to secondplaced Liverpool on Saturday. As Christmas crackers go, this one takes some beating as the two sides that appear most likely to relieve a stuttering Manchester City of their crown face off at Anfield. Twenty eight Premier League games will be crammed in days starting with Aston Villa's home clash with bottom club Sheffield United on Saturday when victory would send Villa top. While Unai Emery's side have emerged as genuine title contenders after successive home league wins, Arsenal and Liverpool are still regarded as City's biggest rivals. Arsenal have not won a Premier League match at Anfield since and have endured a some heavy beatings in the interim period although they did draw in April having led . But Mikel Arteta's side are on a run of five wins in six league games and there is mounting belief they can go one better than last season when they faded in a twohorse race with City. Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp is under no illusion that Arsenal are a far more dangerous beast these days. \"We are going to play probably the strongest team in the Premier League, Arsenal,\" he said after his side's defeat of West Ham United in the quarterfinals of the League Cup on Wednesday. \"They are really physically strong. They didn't get worse with Declan Rice in the team, let me say it like that\" England midfielder Rice, Arsenal's record signing when he joined from West Ham in the summer, has given the Gunners another gear and is justifying the million pounds fee with a string of commanding displays. Liverpool were held to a draw by Manchester United last weekend to miss out on top spot but have not lost at home in the league for more than a year, although Klopp on Wednesday warned the fans about complacency, accusing them of being too quiet. \"We need Anfield on Saturday,\" Klopp said after the win over West Ham. \"We need Anfield on their toes from the first second. If it's too much football in December, I don't know, sorry we have to play it as well. But if you are not in the right shape, give your ticket to somebody else.\" Saturday's action gets under way with West Ham hosting Manchester United while later, fifthplaced Tottenham Hotspur host an Everton side who have won four successive games to climb out of the bottom three despite a point deduction for breaches of the Premier League's financial rules. Premier League history will be made on Saturday when Rebecca Welch becomes the first female referee to take charge of a match after being handed Fulham's home clash with Burnley. While Burnley manager Vincent Kompany praised what he said was a milestone day for the game, his priority will be trying to get his thplaced team out of the relegation zone. Nottingham Forest's new manager Nuno EspiritoSanto, who replaced the popular Steve Cooper this week, will get his first taste of the size of his task as Forest host Bournemouth. Thirdfrombottom Luton Town, whose captain Tom Lockyer was released from hospital on Thursday after suffering cardiac arrest against Bournemouth last weekend, causing the game to be abandoned, take on Newcastle United on Saturday. Chelsea face Wolverhampton Wanderers on Christmas Eve and after a brief Christmas Day respite, the Premier League continues with five games on Boxing Day, the pick of which sees Manchester United host Aston Villa.",

      "article_body": "LIVERPOOL, England, Dec Reuters Liverpool suffered another injury blow as left back Kostas Tsimikas sustained a suspected broken collarbone in the Premier League draw against Arsenal on Saturday. The Greek defender fell awkwardly in the th minute after a strong challenge by Bukayo Saka and collided with Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp who was standing on the touchline. While Klopp quickly got to his feet, Tsimikas was clearly in pain and walked off holding his arm gingerly to be replaced by Joe Gomez. Liverpool are already without firstchoice left back Andy Robertson, also with a shoulder injury. \"It was massively overshadowed by Kostas Tsimikas collarbone issue, definitely broken, so he is out for a long time,\" said Klopp whose side stayed second in the table behind Arsenal. \"The other issues we will have to see. It is hard for us to swallow with the Robbo Andy Robertson situation.\" Talking to Sky Sports, Klopp added \"Of course it effected me. I had no pain but thought maybe Kostas was going to be fine. \"I would happily give my collarbone for him to be fit again. It is not cool when something like that happens in front of you and you are involved in that, I was not sure what even happened or if I fell on him. It is not nice to see.\" Liverpool were second best against Arsenal early on as they trailed to a header by Gabriel. But Mohammed Salah equalised before halftime with a stunning strike and while both sides could have collected all three points, a share of the spoils was just about right. It left Arsenal top of the pile on points with Liverpool and Aston Villa on and Tottenham Hotspur on , two ahead of champions Manchester City who have a game in hand. \"Neither side gave up. Until the last second it was top intensity, everybody felt it, super intense. Tough game, good game, in moments spectacular,\" Klopp said. \"Absolutely, we take confidence from the result. You have to take confidence from these results and performances against a top, top side.\"",

The match was in the th minute with the score after Lockyer collapsed on the pitch with no other player near him. \"Well first of all, I hope he's okay,\" midfielder Eriksen, who suffered a cardiac arrest himself during Denmark's Euro game against Finland in June , told BetFred. \"I've read and seen what's happened and I hope he's okay, takes his time, is in a healthy way and his family are there to support him. I cross my fingers that he's fine. \"My advice to him would be to make the best decision you can. Listen to the doctors and if they tell you to maybe do something else then respect that. \"There's nothing that's going to hold you back, but in the end it all depends on how he's feeling and what the doctors are saying. He has to make the decision with his family on what's next, but he should take his time and focus on himself.\" The Welsh centre back also collapsed in Luton's promotion playoff final win in May and later had surgery to fix an atrial fibrillation, before he was given the green light to continue his playing career.",

      "article_body": "BERLIN, Dec Reuters Borussia Dortmund were held to a draw by visitors Mainz in their final Bundesliga game of the year on Tuesday to make it four league matches without a win, piling more pressure on embattled coach Edin Terzic. Dortmund dominated in a strong start, hitting the woodwork through Jamie BynoeGittens and missing a string of golden chances with Mainz defending desperately. They took the lead with a curled Julian Brandt free kick in the th minute and almost added another seconds later as a Marcel Sabitzer shot bounced off the crossbar. Their wastefulness was punished two minutes before the break when Mainz scored with their first chance of the game as Sepp van den Berg's header from close range crossed the line. Gio Reyna thought he had snatched a thminute winner for the hosts but his effort was ruled offside, leaving Dortmund, with just one win from their last eight league games, in fifth place on points. \"The game showed those two faces we show too often in our game. We had a good start. We created many chances, allowed very little at the back and could have led by more and before the break we conceded the goal,\" Terzic said. \"It was a disappointing evening and we go into the winter break with this disappointment.\" Terzic said he had no doubt that he would still be in charge in the new year despite their bad run. \"Obviously I believe that,\" Terzic said when asked if he would still be Dortmund coach when the league resumed on Jan. . \"That is the task I and the team have to show a different face in the second half of the season.\" The Ruhr valley club, runnersup last season, are already points off the top and four points off fourthplaced VfB Stuttgart, occupying the last Champions League spot, who are in action on Wednesday.",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Jarrod Bowen and Mohammed Kudus' secondhalf goals gave West Ham a win over Manchester United in the Premier League's early game on Saturday, as the Hammers briefly moved into the top six. Bowen bundled home from close range in the nd minute after a lovely onetwo with Lucas Paqueta, who played in Kudus six minutes later to settle the game with a sharp finish. West Ham, recovering from a bruising to Liverpool in the League Cup in midweek, move up to sixth on points. United, who have not scored in their last four games in all competitions, drop to eighth on points. \"We didn't start particularly well but we kept ourselves in the game,\" Hammers boss David Moyes said. Moyes said his side's return of points at this stage in the season was \"a brilliant number of points for us\". He added \"We are not going to be a club who's going to be rattling right at the top we'll try to but until we grow, keep growing, keep improving, try to improve a bit every year, that's all we can do. \"I think we're making pretty good strides and I think today was another good victory.\" The first half was low on quality and its best chance fell to Alejandro Garnacho in the th minute, but the winger lost his balance and shot straight at Alphonse Areola. West Ham nearly scored immediately afterwards, with a dangerous cross from Bowen forcing Jonny Evans into a smart block as the first half ended with more urgency. Bowen nearly opened the scoring shortly after the break with a good header from a James WardProwse corner, but his attempt was well saved by Onana. The winger finally broke the deadlock, however, with his th league goal of the season, taking Paqueta's dinked ball in his stride before Onana's save rebounded off the forward and into the net. Paqueta then capitalised on Kobbie Mainoo's mistake in midfield to set up Kudus, who fired home past Onana to secure all three points for the hosts. The defeat, United's eighth in the league and th in all competitions, will pile further pressure on manager Erik ten Hag, who was taunted by the jubilant West Ham fans before the final whistle. Ten Hag said he thought his side was \"controlling the game\" before they conceded. \"We didn't give West Ham United anything and we created three good chances and we didn't take them,\" Ten Hag told reporters. He called on his players to \"take responsibility\", but backed them to turn United's fortunes around and start scoring again. \"We have players who can do it, they proved it in the past, they can do it but we also have to acknowledge the facts that we didn't do it as a team and so we have to take responsibility,\" Ten Hag said.",

Liverpool, who finished fifth last season, are a point behind leaders Arsenal with matches played, and while Klopp is happy to be in the hunt for top spot he said the intense run of upcoming fixtures can change everything. They face West Ham United in the League Cup quarterfinals on Wednesday before taking on Arsenal in the league at the weekend followed by a midweek trip to Burnley. \"I am happy we are in the area where we are and I don't know why we open that discussion, this bottle, this early,\" Klopp told reporters about the title talk. \"It's December, it's the toughest period of the year. Everybody has to get through it somehow, everybody has to dig really deep to get through it. \"Nobody expected us there. I thought it was possible, but didn't really think about it. So, now we are where we are and now we have to make sure we don't make any negatives out of that.\" With Andrew Robertson, Diogo Jota, Joel Matip, Alexis Mac Allister, Thiago Alcantara and Stefan Bajcetic all sidelined due to injury, Liverpool's squad will be stretched to the fullest over the next few weeks. The departure of Dutch midfielder Ryan Gravenberch after minutes due to injury was not a welcome sight for Klopp. \"I hope it is not that serious but we have in the next days three more games, so I don't know if he will be part of them or one of them. We will see, we have to make a scan,\" added the German.",

Mendes, who turns next month, has been selected for all Cape Verdes previous appearances at the Cup of Nations finals, as has yearold Vozinha who has played all but one of their previous matches at the , and tournaments. However, he would have been hard pressed to keep his place had Cape Verde coach Bubista managed to persuade Varela, a former Portugal under international, to play. Varela, now at Vitoria Guimaraes, said in a social media post on Friday that he was turning down the chance to feature because he did not think it was right to play at the finals without having competed in the qualifiers. Cape Verde have got past the group stage in two of their three previous finals appearances. They compete in Group B in the Ivory Coast, starting against Ghana in Abidjan on Jan. followed by matches versus Mozambique and Egypt. Cape Verde begin their preparations on Saturday in Portugal before moving on to Tunisia where they have a warmup friendly scheduled for Jan. .

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson gave a robust response when asked if he was affected by speculation about his job on Saturday, branding the suggestion \"disrespectful\". The veteran's team snapped an eightmatch run without a win with a over Brentford. But the result came after what Hodgson acknowledged was a \"difficult run\", in which Palace won just one of their last Premier League matches. Hodgson's future was called into question with reports that he could be replaced by Steve Cooper, recently by Nottingham Forest, or other available candidates. Asked by reporters in his press conference whether he thought about the speculation, Hodgson said \"No. I think about the match and what needs to be done. \"There's no point, you can't affect the outside noise. If the noise isn't directed at me it would be directed at somebody else because that's part and parcel of the game. \"No weeks ever go by without noise being directed, so when you've been in football as long as I have you have to understand that, it's part and parcel of football. \"But my attitude has always been 'I'm employed to do a job, I shall do it to the best of my ability'. \"If there are people who want me to leave the club they can tell me and I'll have to do it.\" When Hodgson was asked again about the Cooper speculation and whether Saturday's result had proved his detractors wrong, he gave an unequivocal response. \"I'll tell you what I really think,\" Hodgson said. \"I'm years of age. I have been working years. \"I've got a CBE for my services to football and I've got a CV which is incredible. \"So my final answer to you is that makes no difference or has any interest to me at all and to suggest that it should is disrespectful, that's what I think.\"",

Iraola's Bournemouth were winless in their first nine games, earning only three points to fall into the relegation zone. However, the club stuck by the Spanish coach who was appointed in June and he has led the southcoast side up to th. In their last nine matches, they have picked up points with seven wins and suffered just one loss against champions Manchester City. \"The beginning of the season, the coach had an idea and we lost a lot of games but we just did the same thing,\" Bournemouth goalscorer Justin Kluivert told Amazon Prime. \"We believed in him, he believed in us and the results came.\" Alex Scott, whose scintillating run from the halfway line set up Kluivert's finish, said Iraola's coaching style has had a positive impact on the squad. \"A lot of what we do in training is huge. The confidence, he gives that to very player,\" he said. \"The way he speaks to us, the way he has us training after games. The confidence throughout the team comes from the top. He is a top manager.\" Iraola, who watched Bournemouth's sixth victory in seven games from the stands after he was suspended for the match, credited the players' teamwork for their unbeaten run. \"There are a lot of small things that are clicking. We know each other much better,\" Iraola said. \"Everyone is pushing, there is strong competition for minutes. It's becoming tough for me to make the starting elevens, but it's good for the team.\" When asked what it was like watching his team from the stands, he added \"It was not bad because we didn't suffer as much in the second half. \"I will try to have better behaviour and not have more yellow cards because I prefer the other experience\"",

Juergen Klopp's side had been knocked out of first place by Arsenal earlier on Sunday and would have recaptured a place at the summit with a win but lacked their usual goal threat. A United side shorn of confidence after a miserable week held on grimly for their point although they have now scored just once in their last eight visits to Liverpool. The closest the hosts came to scoring was a Trent AlexanderArnold shot that grazed the post, while Rasmus Hojlund had United's best opportunity. The visitors finished with men after Diogo Dalot was sent off in stoppage time for two yellow cards both for dissent.

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Bologna look to continue their impressive Serie A season when they host Atalanta on Saturday, as the man behind their success, Giovanni Sartori, aims for another footballing miracle. Manager Thiago Motta is deservedly earning plenty of praise for his Bologna side's steady rise up the standings, as their win over AS Roma last weekend took them to fourth place, but behind the scenes Sartori is the unsung hero. The technical director is someone very familiar to Bologna's next opponents Atalanta and their manager Gian Piero Gasperini. Together Sartori and Gasperini took Atalanta from relegation strugglers to regular Champions League football. At Atalanta, Sartori brought in Gasperini and they both took advantage of the club's excellent academy, as well as selling players for big money but always managing to replace them and improve the squad. Sartori signed the likes of Robin Gosens, Ruslan Malinovskyi, Bryan Cristante, Duvan Zapata and Marten de Roon, providing Gasperini with the talent to take the club to new heights. Before Atalanta, Sartori spent years at Chievo Verona, taking them from obscurity in the third tier to the dizzy heights of European football, discovering talents such as Andrea Barzagli, Simone Perrotta, Nicola Legrottaglie and Amauri. In , after parting ways with Atalanta, Sartori arrived at Bologna. After a poor start to last season, he brought in Motta as manager, and they rose from battling relegation to a ninth place finish. Now the pair look set to take the club even higher, with Sartori's signings of Lewis Ferguson, Joshua Zirkzee, Riccardo Calafiori, Remo Freuler and Sam Beukema impressing as Bologna continue their march up the table. They have the third best defensive record in Serie A behind Inter Milan and Juventus, conceding goals in games, and their seven drawn games mean they may not always win but they rarely lose, suffering just two defeats to date. They held both Inter and Juventus to draws away from home, and also drew with title holders Napoli, and the win over Roma was their sixth home victory in eight home games, and Atalanta, two points behind in seventh place, face a stern test. Motta defeated Jose Mourinho last weekend, having played under the Portuguese manager at Inter where they won the treble in . Before that he was part of Gasperini's Genoa side which finished fifth in Serie A. \"I know Thiago well, his team plays the way he played, he never made mistakes,\" Gasperini said after his side's win over Salernitana on Monday. \"They are patient and make important plays. It will be a good test for me too, against a person I know well.\" Bologna fans can hardly have expected their side to be a possible topfour side at Christmas, but they have done so thanks to Motta's aggressive and fluid football, and Sartori's ability to find new talent and replace those who move on. Inter stretched their lead at the top over Juventus to four points last weekend and host thplaced Lecce on Saturday. Juve travel to face Frosinone, th in the standings, on the same day. AC Milan, five points behind Juventus in third place and four ahead of Bologna, are away to bottom side Salernitana on Friday. Roma welcome Napoli to the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday, with Mourinho's side slipping to eighth place, two points behind the champions.",

      "article_body": "BRIGHTON, England, Dec Reuters Tottenham Hotspur's overstretched squad unravelled in a at Brighton Hove Albion on Thursday with manager Ange Postecoglou admitting his team lacked their usual energy. The Londoners, who have maintained their topfour push despite a host of key players missing through injury and suspension, went down on the south coast before a late rally meant they salvaged some pride. Spurs have been without England playmaker James Maddison and Dutch central defender Micky van de Ven since a home defeat by Chelsea at the start of November while Argentine centre back Cristian Romero is also facing a lengthy layoff. Midfielder Yves Bissouma was suspended for the trip to Brighton while Dejan Kulusevski will miss Sunday's home game against Bournemouth after picking up a yellow card on Thursday. \"I know I say I don't make excuses but that doesn't dismiss the enormous efforts of the players, not just today but through this whole period,\" Postecoglou, whose side are fifth in the Premier League with points from games, told reporters. \"They give everything they have, even today. Everything they had in them physically they gave to this game even though sometimes we weren't as sharp as we have been. \"It's difficult. It's been difficult this whole run. We've been stretched for a very long time and we've just tried to play through it. That's what we've done and we're only in the position we are because of the enormous efforts of the players to do jobs that normally is not in their brief.\" Late goals by substitute Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies was proof of Tottenham's fighting spirit but with players heading off to the African Cup of Nations and Asian Cup in January, Postecoglou knows he needs to bolster his squad. \"We've got players injured. The way we play, the players give everything every game. They're a credit to us,\" he said. \"It's very demanding the way we play physically and today we kind of looked like a team that wasn't at its sharpest,\" the Australian added. \"Ultimately what I do know is the players gave everything they have and that's all I can ask for.\" Captain Son Heungmin said the performance was nowhere near the levels Tottenham need to be at. \"Every team is strong in the Premier League and if we're not playing like the last minutes in every game we're going to struggle and this has to be a big wakeup call,\" he said.",

      "article_body": "PARIS, Dec Reuters Paris St Germain forward Kylian Mbappe scored twice to help the Ligue leaders beat Metz at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday and close out the year on a high as they maintained their fivepoint advantage at the top of the table. PSG, who sit top of the standings on points from games, are five points ahead of secondplaced Nice and seven points above AS Monaco, in third. An uneventful first half ended goalless and lacked quality chances for either side, although the Parisians avoided conceding an own goal when a header by defender Danilo Pereira bounced off the post. Vitinha put the hosts in front early into the second half, scoring with his first touch, before Mbappe doubled the lead on the hour mark with a stunning shot from the edge of the box as the France forward celebrated his th birthday. Metz captain Matthieu Udol pulled one back with a towering header following a corner, as the ball went in off the inside of the post, before Mbappe made it profiting on a mistake from the visitors' defence. PSG next travel to Lens in Ligue on Jan. , after facing French Cup winners Toulouse in Trophee des Champions on Jan. and a cup fixture at sixthtier side Revel four days later. In the other fixtures, Nice earned a win over seventhplaced Lens with two quickfire goals in the second half including a penalty from forward Terem Moffi to maintain the second spot. Thirdplaced Monaco came from a goal down to seal a win over lowly Toulouse, before they were down to men six minutes into the second half when midfielder Aleksandr Golovin was sent off for a risky tackle. Patrick Vieira's Strasbourg ended Lille's match unbeaten run with a home win, in a game where both sides scored an own goal each. Lille slipped to fifth in the standings with points. They were leapfrogged by Brest who moved up to fourth after a trashing of lowly Lorient, with all goals scored by midfielder Kamory Doumbia inside the first half. The yearold Mali international became the second player to score four goals in the first half of a Ligue match in the last years, after Edinson Cavani achieved the feat in September with Paris against Caen.",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Jan Reuters Manchester City could have an advantage in the Premier League title race through January as their rivals face up to losing key players to the African Cup of Nations and Asia Cup. As the Premier League emerges from a frantic set of festive fixtures with only six points separating the top five, managers will be busy drawing up contingency plans. Some will likely deem it necessary to dip in to the transfer market to make up for the loss of some top performers. But while Liverpool will lose Egyptian Mohamed Salah and Tottenham Hotspur will have to make do without South Korea's Son Heungmin, champions Manchester City will be unaffected. City manager Pep Guardiola does not have a single player jetting off to either the Ivory Coast or Qatar for the continental tournaments that start on Jan. and Jan. respectively and run for almost a month. Leaders Liverpool, who head Aston Villa by three points after their win over Newcastle United on Monday, will wave goodbye to Salah who with goals is the jointtop scorer in the Premier League this season, equal with Erling Haaland. They will also be missing combative midfielder Wataru Endo who will join up with Japan. \"It's a bit of a shame how he found his feet and now he goes to the Asian Cup,\" manager Juergen Klopp said. Surprise title challengers Villa will only lose squad player Bertrand Traore to Burkina Faso but fourthplaced Arsenal will be harder hit with Mohamed Elneny Egypt, Thomas Partey Ghana and Takehiro Tomiyasu Japan all heading off for an unspecified amount of time, depending on the progress of their nations. Tottenham have been bedevilled by injuries in the last couple of months and now manager Ange Postecoglou will have to adapt to captain Son, who has scored league goals, representing South Korea. Tottenham also lose midfielder Yves Bissouma to Mali while Pape Sarr, who was injured against Bournemouth on Sunday, is part of Senegal's squad. Resurgent West Ham, who are in sixth place, will be hampered by the loss key Ghanian midfielder Mohammed Kudus. Manchester United's underpressure manager Erik Ten Hag could do without losing Andre Onana Cameroon, Sofyan Amrabat Morocco and Amad Diallo Ivory Coast as he tries to turn around what has been a dreadful season so far. At the other end of the table, Nottingham Forest are the worst hit as they prepare to make do without six players for the next few weeks including Ivory Coast trio Serge Aurier, Willy Boly and Ibrahim Sangare. Struggling Brentford will be without midfielders Saman Ghoddos Iran and Frank Onyeka Nigeria along with striker Yoane Wissa DR Congo. The Premier League takes a breather this weekend with the FA Cup third round taking precedence while all clubs will have one of the two following weekends off in a mini winter break. By that stage the group stages of the AFCON and Asia Cup will be virtually over, meaning some players may be heading back.",

Barca have won just one of their last four league games, dealing a blow to their hopes of defending their LaLiga title and leaving them third in the standings, nine points behind leaders Girona and seven behind rivals Real Madrid. The Catalan outfit were held to a at Valencia in their last league match, in which striker Robert Lewandowski missed a slew of chances, before Valencia's Hugo Guillamon scored a thminute equaliser. \"We lack conviction in all areas and need to be more effective and decisive in defence and attack,\" Xavi told reporters ahead of Wednesday's game at the Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys against bottom club Almeria. \"I think the reason why we are nine points behind Girona is because of our own mistakes... It's a difference that we can make up. It's a matter of not slipping up and starting to rack up wins, starting against Almeria. \"To win the league, we need to take things step by step, we need to win games, we need the fans and we need to put in a complete performance, which is something we haven't been doing yet.\" Barcelona have also had to contend with a string of injuries to key players, with keeper MarcAndre ter Stegen having undergone back surgery and Spain midfielder Gavi sidelined with a ligament tear. Xavi said Barca are hoping to sign new players in the January transfer window, but added that they would spend within their means after having had financial struggles in recent years. \"What we are looking for is to always strengthen the squad, in every window if we can,\" the Spaniard said. \"With Gavi's injury we need a profile of his type but it's not easy to find another Gavi on the market. We will see the famous financial 'fair play'. If we have space, we will sign someone. We are working with Deco sporting director and the president.\" Xavi added that Brazilian forward Vitor Roque, signed from Club Athletico Paranaense, would join the squad after the LaLiga's winter break.",

      "article_body": "LIVERPOOL, England, Dec Reuters Everton manager Sean Dyche labelled the handball laws a farce after his side conceded a crucial secondhalf penalty in their Premier League defeat by Manchester City on Wednesday. Everton were level at with the champions just past the hour mark when Amadou Onana lunged to try and block a shot by City's Nathan Ake. The ball struck Onana's arm from pointblank range and referee John Brooks pointed to the spot after being instructed by his assistant on the touchline. VAR opted not to reverse the decision and Julian Alvarez tucked away the penalty to make it before Bernardo Silva wrapped up the points for City late on. Handball decisions have become magnified since the introduction of VAR with the interpretation of whether or not the arm is in a \"natural\" position often very subjective. \"We can debate the penalty all day. It has been by managers on Zoom calls to say it's a farce but that's the way it goes,\" Dyche told Amazon Prime. \"That's completely natural. He's not putting his arm up to save it, he's literally jumping in to try to block the ball. How that is given as a penalty is bizarre in my world but I must be from a different planet. \"Tonight the linesman gives that and he's yards away so I don't know who is giving what any more. Who knows All the managers are debating it. Someone needs to stand up at some point and realise that can't be a penalty because he's just throwing himself in front of it to try to block the ball.\" Former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg, speaking to Amazon Prime, said Brooks made the right decision. \"No one is saying that the decision is wrong but we are saying that by the way the law is written, it is wrong and therefore that is something that needs changing,\" he said. \"We are seeing some given and some not given every week.\"",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Napoli go into their Serie A game with Monza without the suspended Victor Osimhen and Matteo Politano, and mounting injury problems are also cause for concern for manager Walter Mazzarri. Osimhen and Politano were both sent off in last weekend's defeat at AS Roma. Stanislav Lobotka went off injured in that game and another midfielder, Jesper Lindstrom, missed that game through injury and both are doubtful for the Monza match. \"We're in quite an emergency, I've even made a list,\" Mazzarri told a press conference on Thursday. \"Lobotka is a first choice, if he's fit he will play. If he doesn't make it I have great confidence in Jens Cajuste, who will become very strong. \"Lindstrom, even if he's fit, doesn't have ninety minutes in him, and so will either start or come on from the bench.\" Brazilian defender Natan came on late in the game with Roma, and despite suffering a shoulder injury, remained on the pitch with Napoli already down to nine men. \"The doctor told me that it will take a month and a half, so he won't be back for now,\" Mazzarri confirmed. The manager also announced an injury to Diego Demme, and although Eljif Elmas signed for Red Bull Leipzig on Wednesday, the manager is not expecting too much from the upcoming transfer window. \"I'm not expecting a revolution because you don't and can't do it in January. \"You know very well that I prefer the club to talk about the market, I want to help the players regain the confidence of last year.\" With both Osimhen and Politano suspended, Mazzarri must choose between Giovanni Simeone or Giacomo Raspadori for Friday's game with Monza. \"Making them play together would mean making a big change to the formation and in any case you need to have a striker on the bench,\" Mazzarri said. \"We'll see who will start and who will come on during the game.\" Since Osimhen returned from a hamstring injury, the Nigerian has scored just once in five league games, and his sending off against Roma was a disappointing way to end his time with Napoli before leaving to join the national team. Osimhen will join the Nigeria squad for the African Cup of Nations finals in January. \"Since he came back, he has been battered even when the ball is far away,\" Mazzarri said. \"Maybe he felt the responsibility after such a great campaign last season, it can happen to make mistakes when nervous. Unfortunately he was back from injury and now there's the African Cup of Nations. \"I forgive him, not because I'm a good guy but because he needs to be protected.\" Napoli are seventh in the standings with points, one point behind Roma in sixth, while Monza are th on points.",

      "article_body": "LIVERPOOL, England, Dec Reuters Arsenal laid down their title credentials with an impressive performance in an intense draw at Liverpool on Saturday and will top the Premier League table at Christmas. Mikel Arteta's team, last season's runnersup who have won five of their last seven matches but not tasted victory in a league game at Anfield since , have points from games. Liverpool are second on points, ahead of Aston Villa on goal difference. \"An unbelievable game of football, one of the most intense I've witnessed in years in this league,\" Arteta told the BBC. \"For many moments we were on top, in the last minutes we wanted it more, but a draw is a fair result.\" In of the last seasons, the leaders on Christmas Day have gone on to win the title. Champions Manchester City are fifth, but have played one fewer game. \"Oh my god, how strong are they The good news is we are good as well,\" Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said of Arsenal. \"In a game like this, going down early to a set piece is tough, especially with the speed of Arsenal. But the game we played, how we started second half we should have scored. \"We pass instead of shoot, four or five times we do that, it's a lesson. But generally the game is great.\" Klopp had urged fans to crank up the volume at Anfield after a couple of uncharacteristically quiet games at the Merseyside stadium. Although the fans obliged, Arsenal took an early lead when Gabriel outwitted Cody Gakpo to head in a floated pass from captain Martin Odegaard in the fourth minute. \"It was really loud from the beginning, they did their bit to generate that,\" Arteta said. \"I love that our players could handle this, it's not easy.\" Liverpool forward Mohammed Salah scored a brilliant equaliser in the th minute when Trent AlexanderArnold found him with a pinpoint long pass. Salah stepped easily around Oleksandr Zinchenko before unleashing a fierce leftfoot shot into the net. Salah's goal was his st in the Premier League to put him th on the alltime list and the hosts had great chances to net the winner. Liverpool were screaming for a penalty after what appeared to be a blatant hand ball by Odegaard and Salah led a fullspeed counterattack to set up Trent AlexanderArnold whose shot struck the crossbar. Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka curled a shot wide in the dying minutes that deflected off Virgil van Dijk's back, but both teams had to settle for a point, a good result for Manchester City. Liverpool lost Kostas Tsimikas to what Klopp said was a broken collarbone in the first half when Saka barrelled into the defender near the touchline, taking down Klopp as well. Tsimikas walked gingerly off the pitch with the aid of medical staff clutching his shoulder.",

The Egyptian side, appearing in their fourth consecutive thirdplace playoff, finished third in , and , while Japan's Urawa came third in . AlAhly took the lead in the th minute when a short corner move found Mohamed Hany well outside the box and his fierce strike was parried by the keeper and Yasser Ibrahim pounced from close range. Six minutes later AlAhly doubled their lead when Atsuki Ito lost possession on the edge of his own area and Ahmed Koka's pass found Percy Tau who had plenty of time to take a touch before firing past Shusaku Nishikawa. Just when it looked like AlAhly were cruising, Urawa pulled a goal back when Jose Kante hit a firsttime volley in the rd minute to score in his final game having announced his retirement in November. Urawa came out with renewed belief after the break and in the th minute Alexander Scholz fired a penalty down the middle to level the scores after a handball by Mohammed Hany. It took just six minutes for AlAhly to retake the lead, however, as a poor shot from Ali Maaloul took a wicked deflection off Urawa defender Yoshio Koizumi and flew past his own keeper. In the th minute AlAhly had the chance to restore their twogoal lead but Maaloul's penalty was saved by Nishikawa diving low to his right to keep his side in the game. Urawa piled on late pressure but were unable to find another goal, and the Egyptians wrapped up the win in the ninth minute of added time when Maaloul made up for his penalty miss with a stunning free kick.",

      "article_body": "MANCHESTER, England, Dec Reuters Jim Ratcliffe becoming a minority shareholder in Manchester United finally ended the drawnout ownership saga and while the deal will not give supporters their desired clean break from the unpopular Glazer family, it signals a fresh start for the club. The deal is far from the multibillion dollar takeover initially expected but supporters will welcome his input as they look forward to their club regaining their position at the peak of English and European football. The British billionaire and owner of petrochemicals giant INEOS bought a stake for per share, United said on Sunday, following a bidding process that lasted more than months. The yearold is also investing million intended to upgrade the club's ageing infrastructure that invariably has visiting fans, often soaked by water pouring through the holes in the roof, chanting \"Old Trafford is falling down\". Ratcliffe's investment means he has been given the responsibility of running the sporting side of the business, which is welcome news for a club that stumbled to their worst start to a season since and have not won a league title since Alex Ferguson retired as manager in . The Glazers will remain in control, but how the dynamic between them and Ratcliffe will unfold is one of the great unanswered questions of the new arrangement. Ratcliffe grew up in a council house in the Manchester area, where his fascination with industry reportedly grew from the factory smoke stacks he could see from his bedroom window. After studying chemical engineering at Birmingham University he did an MBA at London Business School and went on to become one of Britain's richest businessmen, founding INEOS in . He is the chemical company's chairman and chief executive officer with a twothirds stake, and Forbes pegs his net worth at about billion. Ratcliffe is well versed in sports ownership as INEOS owns French Ligue club Nice, Swiss Super League side FC LausanneSport, and works with Racing Club Abidjan in the Ivory Coast. His attempt to buy Chelsea, when former owner Roman Abramovich's assets were frozen following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, failed to work out. He is also in control of the INEOS Grenadiers cycling team, who as Team Sky were one of the world's most successful teams. He is also a onethird shareholder of MercedesAMG Petronas Formula One team and competes with sailing crew INEOS Britannia in the America's Cup. United's American owners the Glazers had announced about a year ago that they would seek outside investment, to the delight of supporters. Fans have been crying out for new owners for years as they blamed the Glazers for burdening the club with debt and their chants of \"Glazers out\" can be regularly heard at games. Qatar's Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al Thani was also looking to buy the club but dropped out of the process, saying he would not be raising his billion offer. Adding to the misery is United's decline on the pitch since Ferguson's retirement. United appeared to be turning the tide after Erik Ten Hag guided them to their first trophy in six years when they captured the League Cup last season. They went on to finish third in the Premier League, points behind champions and crosstown rivals Manchester City, who have not only taken United's role as the country's most successful club, but also leapfrogged them in terms of spending power. This season they got off to an abysmal start losing five of their first league games, and have already been eliminated from the League Cup and Champions League, leaving Ten Hag looking vulnerable months into the job. But for a club that claims more than million global fans and own a record top flight English titles, Ratcliffe's arrival will at least give fans some hope that could see the start of the longawaited turnaround.",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Tottenham Hotspur's demanding style of play has taken its toll on the players and though they need a stronger squad to tackle the rigours of the Premier League, there may not be much transfer business in January, manager Ange Postecoglou has said. Spurs began the season in sublime form, going matches unbeaten to top the league, but five defeats coupled with injuries have seen them fall to fifth at the halfway stage of the season six points behind leaders Liverpool. James Maddison, Cristian Romero, Rodrigo Bentancur, Micky van de Ven, Ryan Sessegnon and Manor Solomon are out injured while Ivan Perisic is sidelined for the rest of the season with an ACL injury. While most players are set to return to action in the next few weeks, Postecoglou does not expect reinforcements when the transfer window opens on Jan. . In addition, longtime keeper Hugo Lloris could also leave. \"The transfer window Nothing magical is going to happen in the window. What we need to do is keep building,\" Postecoglou told reporters ahead of Sunday's home game against Bournemouth. \"We've had one window with this team to change to around and to things differently. The fact we're in the position we are is a credit to the players. Throughout all the challenges we've had, we keep ploughing forward. \"We'll see what we can do in January, but ultimately it's about building a side to get us where we want to get to.\" Postecoglou's aggressive and fast attacking style of play has taken its toll and the Australian said sustaining that over a season requires a stronger squad. \"It has tested the limits of our ability to play the football we want in the context of the injuries we have,\" Postecoglou added. \"It would be unfair to judge some players. The way we play takes a hefty physical toll compared to how other clubs play. For us to sustain it, we need a strong squad and we're nowhere near that at the moment. \"We've had one window, so it was never going to happen. But we want to compete and we've got ourselves into the position where we can compete. That's what we need to keep pushing forward for.\"",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Danny Welbeck headed a stunning late equaliser as Brighton Hove Albion held Crystal Palace to a draw on Thursday, denying the home side a first victory at Selhurst Park since Sept. in a disappointing result for both sides. \"I think we lost two points,\" Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi told Sky Sports. \"It is because we made too many mistakes, especially in the first half. In the second half we played with more energy, to find the chance to score.\" Brighton, who have just two wins in league games, climbed to eighth in the table with points after games. Roy Hodgson's Palace, who were coming off a shock draw at Manchester City last weekend , are th on points. \"As a group we are a bit disappointed because we wanted to come here and get the three points,\" Welbeck told Sky. \"I feel like we should be a bit higher in the table with the way we've performed and there have been some results that got away from us. It happened again tonight.\" Palace looked to be heading towards victory after Jordan Ayew scored just before the break in a drab first half when Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen hesitated and gave up possession. Michael Olise sent in a pinpoint cross to the back post that Ayew dove to head in. But Brighton responded with secondhalf shots and Welbeck, who entered the game after halftime, scored with a brilliant header in the nd minute his th Premier League goal to silence the Palace crowd. With his back to the net, Welbeck leapt high to send it into the top corner, turning around to watch the flight of the ball. \"I am still making my way back from injury but I felt good and have been feeling good all week,\" Welbeck said. \"I was just trying to make an impact. To get the goal is good but I am disappointed not to get the three points. \"It's nice to be back on the scoresheet,\" he added. \"But we want to be getting three points more consistently.\" It was remarkably the fifth successive time this clash has ended at Selhurst. The Seagulls almost got the winner in what would have been a bizarre goal when Palace keeper Dean Henderson rushed out to punch the ball away, but bounced it hard off Welbeck's head and backwards toward the net. It rolled just wide of the net. \"It's frustrating, we played a really good first half, I don't remember them having clear cut chances,\" Palace defender Joachim Andersen told Sky. \"But Danny Welbeck scores a fantastic goal, that's just quality with them. We played a decent match, but just got tired in the second half.\"",

Arsenal, who are top of the table with points from matches, face secondplaced Liverpool on Saturday. The north London outfit's last successful Premier League trip to Anfield came in when Arteta was still playing for Arsenal. \"It is going to be a special atmosphere for both teams and it is strong opposition. We will prepare to win it and go for it it will be an intense match,\" Arteta told reporters. \"It is always great to be in the highest position in this league and we will try to maintain that, but we have to be intelligent to manage the game. \"Last time we beat them was a while ago and it was a good moment, which is something we can replicate tomorrow...\" The Spanish manager provided an injury update on a trio of injured midfielders, saying \"Thomas Partey is still finalising his rehab. He hasn't trained with the team yet. \"Mo Elneny hopefully will train with us today. Jorginho is still a doubt.\" Arteta also weighed in on Thursday's European Court of Justice that UEFA and FIFA contravened EU law when they prevented the formation of a Super League. \"We are very clear. It is exactly the same. We remain in the same position,\" Arteta said. \"We love playing in the Champions League and we'll continue to do so. \"Football supporters and the passion they bring to game is the main reason this game belongs to them. We have to look after them their opinion is very important.\" Arsenal, who were among six Premier League clubs who signed up for the Super League project in before withdrawing amid fan protests, also posted a statement on Friday distancing themselves from the Super League.",

Liverpool had missed the chance to go top of the league on Sunday after a draw with Manchester United but they blew away West Ham to book a record th appearance in the Cup semis on Wednesday. Despite Liverpool's dominance, Klopp thought the atmosphere was lacking at Anfield. \"It's long ago that I said this but I thought the first half a little bit, when the boys played really exceptional, I was not overly happy ... with the atmosphere behind me,\" Klopp told reporters. \"We changed a lot of things. We dominated West Ham like crazy. We missed chances. And I mean, if I would be in the stand I would be on my toes, ,.\" Liverpool partly opened their newly revamped Anfield Road Stand for the first time on Sunday, bumping up the attendance to , the largest for years at their stadium. With leaders Arsenal set to visit on Saturday, Klopp said getting the right atmosphere was crucial. \"We need Anfield on their toes from the first second without me having an argument with the opposition coach. We need you from the first second,\" he added. \"If you really want, if it's too much football in December, I don't know. Sorry we have to play it as well. But if you are not in the right shape, give your ticket to somebody else.\"",

      "article_body": "JEDDAH, Dec Reuters Manchester City outclassed Urawa Red Diamonds in a victory in the King Abdullah Sports City stadium on Tuesday to set up a Club World Cup final showdown against Brazilian side Fluminense. European champions City were frustrated by a wellorganised Japanese side during the opening half but took the lead with an own goal by Marius Hoibraten in stoppage time. Mateo Kovacic made it in the nd minute with his first goal since joining City from Chelsea and Bernardo Silva's deflected shot a few minutes later meant City could play the rest of the game in cruise control. Pep Guardiola's City, who had won only three of their previous eight games in all competitions, are looking to become the fourth English club to win the title after Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea. They will start as heavy favourites in Friday's final against Copa Libertadores champions Fluminense who on Monday beat Egypt's AlAhly . \"The players know how important it is for the club,\" Guardiola, who won the title twice with Barcelona and once with Bayern Munich, said. \"To be in this final, you have to do incredible things like win the Champions League. This may be the only time we play this in our lifetime. \"We will try to win the title we don't have to complete the circle.\" City have suffered some domestic wobbles of late and have slipped off the pace in the Premier League in their quest for a fourth successive title. But even with Erling Haaland still missing and Guardiola shuffling his pack after Saturday's draw with Crystal Palace, they had far too much for the J League side. The Diamonds' gameplan was obvious as they packed their defence and midfield to create a red wall in front of their goal and it worked well as City struggled to find openings. Despite barely getting out of their own half they almost made it to halftime on level terms but were undone as Matheus Nunes finally found some space and his low cross was intercepted by Hoibraten who steered the ball into his own goal. The game opened up in the second half with Diamonds showing a little more adventure but it made it easy for City. Kovacic, twice a winner of the competition with Real Madrid and once with Chelsea, was sent clear and he surged away before smashing a shot high past Shusaku Nishikawa. City wrapped it up when Nishikawa made a fine save but the ball fell to Bernardo Silva whose shot took a nick off Hoibraten and went just inside the post. All that was left then for City was to make sure of a first clean sheet since Nov. . Urawa Red Diamonds will face AlAhly in the thirdplaced playoff on Friday.",

Unbeaten in their last matches, Juventus now have points from games. Inter, who are a point ahead, play Lecce later on Saturday. Juve took the lead when their early pressure on Frosinone saw goalkeeper Stefano Turati fluff his clearance as the ball fell to midfielder Filip Kostic, who found Turkey international Kenan Yildiz ahead of him. The yearold, making his first start for Juve, cut through three defenders to fire in at the near post with an impeccably timed finish in the th minute. \"I have confidence in myself and I did things as usual,\" Yildiz said. \"They his team mates told me I have to buy dinner. We are a group, we fight for the fans and hope to finish the season in first place.\" But Juve lost their advantage six minutes into the second half when Jaime Baez, who replaced an injured Pol Lirola, chased Ilario Monterisi's lofted through ball and fired past onrushing keeper Wojciech Szczesny. Frosinone were on the verge of another big result after Tuesday's at Italian champions Napoli, but were undone in the st minute when Juve's Vlahovic rose above the defence to head home Weston McKennie's cross. The Serbian striker found the net again in the th minute but VAR chalked it off for offside. However, Juve held on to seal the three points and leave Frosinone th in the standings.",

Foster was initially included in South Africa's preliminary squad for the tournament despite Burnley informing them that he would be unable to travel. He was eventually from the final squad on Thursday. The Africa Cup of Nations kicks off in Ivory Coast on Jan. . \"It's a sensible decision from the South African FA, in terms of supporting the advice of experts,\" Kompany told reporters. \"We didn't have Lyle available for a month or more because we tried to put him first and part of his rehabilitation is being in a small environment. \"It's the travelling and everything else, the people who advised us throughout this period didn't think it was time yet for Lyle.\" Foster was due to a recurring mental health issue before returning in December to play for Burnley in league games against Everton, Fulham and Liverpool. South Africa manager Hugo Broos and Kompany the player's mental health issues with medical staff before making the decision to exclude him from squad. \"Collectively we are doing something that is good for a South African human being, before we call him a player,\" Kompany added. \"We're taking care of him and looking after him. He'll be ready to perform for his country again at some point.\"",

Villa came from behind to secure a victory at Brentford's Community Stadium, with Ollie Watkins scoring an thminute winner against his former club and sparking a goalmouth melee with his celebrations. Brentford defender Ben Mee was sent off after minutes for a foul on substitute Leon Bailey, while Villa midfielder Boubacar Kamara was given a red card for violent conduct in added time. Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez's attempt to drag Brentford striker Neal Maupay to his feet prompted another flashpoint. The referee booked other players plus both managers Frank for his complaints about Mee's red card and Emery for going onto the pitch to restrain Martinez. All cards came in the second half. \"I want to analyse collectively and individually with the players, but it is my spirit when we are playing and winning to try to respect everything,\" Emery told Sky Sports. \"On the pitch, the players are excited, both teams had some nervous moments, and things like what we saw can happen. \"My message before the matches is always the same respect ourselves, respect the opponent, respect the referees. We lost a little bit of our minds today in some of those behaviours, I want to focus and react to control it.\" Frank was also not happy with his side's conduct and said there were too many situations where he thought 'No, that's not how it should be\". \"It should be the beautiful game in a physical contest between two teams and there should be a winner, but unfortunately there were situations that will take the headlines,\" he added. Villa are flying high in third place, just a point behind leaders Arsenal, while Brentford are th having lost five of their last six league games.",

Following are details of how the tournament will work The United States will host the edition of the expanded event, which will be held every four years thereafter. The tournament will have eight groups of four with the top two teams from each group going through to the knockout stages the same format as the World Cup. The current version of the FIFA Club World Cup an annual competition with seven teams will be discontinued after the tournament now being hosted by Saudi Arabia. Europe will have teams in the new competition and South America will have six, while Africa, Asia and North America will have four each. Oceania has one slot, while the final slot will be allocated to a club from the host country. Clubs will be ranked based on sporting criteria over four seasons to secure qualification for the Club World Cup. Teams will get three points for a win, one point for a draw and three points for progress to each stage of their confederation's premier competition. In Europe, UEFA's club coefficients system will be used, with teams getting two points for a win, one point for a draw, four points for qualification for the group stage, five points for qualification for the last and one point for progress to each stage of the competition thereafter. Confederation champions from will be eligible to play in the new Club World Cup, meaning Chelsea, Real Madrid and last season's Champions League winners Manchester City have qualified from Europe. The other European teams who have qualified based on the points system are Bayern Munich, Paris St Germain, Inter Milan, FC Porto and Benfica. Only two teams from one country can qualify for the tournament unless they win the continental competition. For example, since Chelsea and City have qualified from England, Arsenal can qualify only if they win the Champions League this season. From South America, Brazilian sides Palmeiras, Flamengo and Fluminense have qualified as Copa Libertadores champions, while Asian sides Al Hilal and Urawa Red Diamonds are also through. Al Ahly and Wydad have similarly qualified from Africa while Monterrey, Seattle Sounders and Club Leon are through from North America.

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Aston Villa got back to winning ways and climbed into second place in the Premier League on Saturday, while Manchester City concluded a remarkable year with a victory and reminder they remain firmly in the hunt for a record fourth straight title. Manchester United's chronic inconsistency returned, however, as they went down at Nottingham Forest to complete a miserable first half of the season. Unai Emery's Villa are title dark horses but looked like dropping points against visiting man Burnley before an thminute penalty from Douglas Luiz earned them a win. Villa's match home winning streak in the league was ended by lowly Sheffield United in a draw last week and they then lost at Manchester United on Boxing Day having led . Saturday's victory moved Villa level on points with Liverpool, who lead on goal difference and host Newcastle United on Monday. Manchester City, who also have a game in hand on Villa, are third on after a win over Sheffield United. After games last season, not long into Spaniard Emery's reign, Villa had points underlining the resurgence the Midlands side have enjoyed in the past months in which they have won a club record games in all competitions. Leon Bailey fired Villa in front against Burnley, who responded through Zeki Amdouni's volley two minutes later. A simple finish from Moussa Diaby put the hosts back in front after minutes before Burnley went down to men when Sander Berge got a second yellow card for tugging Luiz's shirt. Battling Burnley levelled late on through Lyle Foster but Luiz got the chance to win the game from the penalty spot when Jhon Duran was fouled by Aaron Ramsey, although his spot kick only just found the net after thudding the underside of the bar. If Villa's year has been impressive, Manchester City's has been truly spectacular as they won a Premier LeagueFA CupChampions League treble last season and last week were crowned FIFA for the first time. They barely had to engage third gear on Saturday to end a run of three successive home league draws by comfortably beating bottom club Sheffield United. Phil Foden set up Rodri to open the scoring with a precise finish in the th minute and the England midfielder was instrumental in City's second goal just past the hour as his pass was tapped home by Julian Alvarez. After a wobble, City now appear to be back in the groove. \"So tight we're not top of the league, Liverpool are better,\" City manager Pep Guardiola said. \"Now rest, we all need it. January is less intense than November and December so we prepare for what's next.\" Manchester United's ninth league defeat of the season means they have fewer points and goals after games of a Premier League season than ever before. Nicolas Dominguez broke the deadlock at the City Ground in the th minute to give Forest the lead but a mistake by home goalkeeper Matt Turner allowed Marcus Rashford to level. Morgan GibbsWhite curled in a superb winner though to push Forest away from danger and leave Erik ten Hag's seventhplaced United having to go back to the drawing board. Chelsea kicked off the day's fixtures with a victory at Luton Town to end a run of four successive away defeats. Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead in the th minute and was at the heart of the second goal in the th when he teed up Noni Madueke to score his second goal in two games. Nicolas Jackson then sent Palmer clear to make it in the th minute but Luton were not finished as late goals by Ross Barkley and Elijah Adebayo ensured a nervy finale. Everton's dismal Christmas continued with a third straight defeat, slumping at Wolverhampton Wanderers to stay one place above the drop zone on points, one more than thplaced Luton.

Manchester United were one of the first to say they remain committed to playing in competitions run by Europe's soccer governing body UEFA, as did German champions Bayern Munich. United were one of the clubs involved in the formation of the breakaway Super League in April but pulled out due to pressure from fans, governments and players. \"Our position has not changed. We remain fully committed to participation in UEFA competitions, and to positive cooperation with UEFA, the Premier League, and fellow clubs through the ECA on the continued development of the European game,\" the club said. Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur were the other five Premier League clubs involved before pulling out. Two months after the six English clubs pulled out of the project in , they said they would offer a combined million pounds . million as \"a gesture of goodwill\" to go towards the good of the game, including new investment to support fans, grassroots football and community programmes. The Premier League said they would face a point deduction if they attempt a similar move in future and each would be fined million pounds for any such breakaway attempt. \"The ruling does not endorse the socalled \"European Super League\" and the Premier League continues to reject any such concept,\" the Premier League said in a statement. \"Supporters are of vital importance to the game and they have time and again made clear their opposition to a 'breakaway' competition that severs the link between domestic and European football.\" Bayern Munich said they were committed to UEFA competitions, saying the door for the Super League \"remains closed\" for the German champions. \"The Bundesliga is the foundation of FC Bayern, just as all national leagues are the foundation of other European football clubs,\" Bayern CEO Jan Christian Dreesen said. \"It is therefore our duty and our deep conviction to strengthen them, not to weaken them. We are also committed to the European club competitions under the umbrella of UEFA.\" The German Football League DFL, which is in charge of the Bundesliga, said it \"explicitly supports the European sports model and rejects competitions outside those competitions organised by the federations and the leagues\". The European Club Association ECA, which represents nearly clubs across the continent, said the football world had \"moved on from the Super League years ago\". \"Through ECA, clubs today are already at the heart of decisionmaking in relation to the competitions they participate in,\" the ECA said. \"Most importantly, football is a social contract not a legal contract. \"All the recognised stakeholders... spanning confederations, federations, clubs, leagues, players and fans stand more united than ever against the attempts by a few individuals pursuing personal agendas to undermine the very foundations and basic principles of European football.\" France's Ligue de Football Professionnel LFP said it \"unequivocally supports\" competitions organised by UEFA. The Italian Football Federation FIGC reiterated its intention to protect the national championships, \"for the defence of the broader and more general principle of sporting merit and the respect of international calendars\". \"The FIGC believes that the Super League is not a project compatible with these conditions and will always act in pursuing the general interests of Italian football,\" it added. . pounds",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Misfiring Arsenal spurned the opportunity to reclaim first place in the Premier League as they lost to spirited fellow Londoners West Ham United at the Emirates on Thursday. West Ham only had three efforts on target but Tomas Soucek gave them a halftime lead before former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos extended the advantage after the break. Arsenal had more than twice as many chances but failed to take any as the visitors defended gamely. Secondplaced Arsenal remain on points, two behind Liverpool who beat Burnley on Tuesday. \"This is a very disappointing night for us,\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told reporters. \"We have to put the ball in the net and win it the game.\" West Ham took the lead against the run of play after minutes when Soucek netted after a pullback from Jarrod Bowen who looked as if he just managed to keep the ball in play. \"It's difficult because the ball was in the air,\" Bowen told Amazon Prime. \"It was hard to tell. It would have been easier to tell if it had been on the ground.\" After that it was an Arsenal blitz with Bukayo Saka hitting the post and Gabriel Jesus missing two good chances before Mavropanos scored his first league goal for the Hammers with a thumping header from a James WardProwse corner in the th. \"I think the best moment to score my first goal for West Ham and in the Premier League,\" said Mavropanos. \"We work a lot on the setpieces, so it was great. It is an important win for everyone and for our boss. We are really happy.\" West Ham could have made it three from three chances but Said Benrahma had a penalty saved by David Raya in added time after a foul by former West Ham captain Declan Rice. The defeat raises familiar questions about Arsenal's title credentials. They led the league this time last year only to falter in the run in and be overtaken by Manchester City. It may have been one of those nights when things just did not happen in front of goal but finishing remains an issue. As well as striking the post, Saka also had a near pointblank header stopped by Alphonse Areola, who made a string of fine saves in the second half too. Jesus should have a scored when Arsenal were still one goal behind but headed over an open goal while fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli also missed good opportunities. The win leaves West Ham in sixth place on points and marked a landmark night for their manager David Moyes who had never won at Arsenal in the league in attempts.",

Dominik Szoboszlai, Cody Gakpo and talisman Mohamed Salah, who did not enter the game until it was an hour old, also scored for Juergen Klopp's team in what unravelled into a rout in the final minutes. \"The performance, the scoresheet, the result and the individual performances put together to make a team on the pitch,\" a delighted Klopp told Sky Sports. \"The boys enjoyed it a lot, they worked hard but enjoyed it too with joyful football in moments. Nice to see.\" Szoboszlai netted in the th minute with a thunderous strike from yards that sailed into the far corner. Jones doubled Liverpool's lead with his first goal minutes into the second half after a giveandgo with Darwin Nunez, sprinting onto Nunez's pass to onetime his shot through keeper Alphonse Areola's legs. Gakpo scored from the top of the yard box before Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for the Hammers in the th minute. Salah put the game away in the nd minute and Jones completed his brace two minutes later, slashing through West Ham's defence with such ease it had manager David Moyes seething with anger. \"I want to score goals and help the team,\" Jones said. \"It is okay playing well but you need to score goals, I've scored two so a big smile on my face.\" West Ham were in for a tough night against the ninetime League Cup champions even before the opening whistle, hampered by illness ahead of the game and having only won once in the cauldron of Anfield in years. Chelsea, Fulham and Championship side Middlebrough also made the last four. Chelsea and Fulham booked their places on Tuesday night with penaltyshootout wins over Newcastle United and Everton respectively. \"An important game to get through. We did our best and it was a good game in the end,\" Gakpo said. \"We have a good team, we have amazing players. The only thing we have to do is stay focused and stay together and keep working hard and then the quality will come out.\" The semifinal first legs will be played the week of Jan. , and the second legs beginning Jan. . The final is Feb. at Wembley Stadium, and fans at rainlashed Anfield, keen to see their team in the final, chanted \"Wembley\" in the final minutes on Wednesday. Liverpool were coming off a frustrating Premier League draw against Manchester United on Sunday. Wednesday's score could have been even more lopsided with several nearmisses, including a Darwin Nunez shot that rang off the post in the second half. Salah then sent the rebound just wide.",

      "article_body": "Jan Reuters Wayne Rooney has been dismissed as the manager of Birmingham City after less than three months in the role, the secondtier Championship club said on Wednesday, after a winless run left them hovering above the relegation zone. Rooney was Birmingham manager in October when the club were sixth in the table, but they have since fallen to th place, six points above the relegation zone. After Rooney took charge, the club lost nine of their matches, winning only two. They have been winless in their last five outings. \"Birmingham City has today parted company with manager, Wayne Rooney and first team coach Carl Robinson,\" the club said in a statement. \"Despite their best efforts, results have not met the expectations that were made clear at the outset. Therefore, the board feels that a change in management is in the best interests of the Football Club.\" Rooney took over from John Eustace after resigning as coach of Major League Soccer MLS club DC United, signing a threeandahalfyear contract. \"I would like to thank Tom Wagner, Tom Brady and Garry Cook for the opportunity to manage Birmingham City FC and the support they all gave me during my short period with the club,\" Rooney said in a statement. \"Football is a results business and I recognise they have not been at the level I wanted them to be. However, time is the most precious commodity a manager requires and I do not believe weeks was sufficient to oversee the changes that were needed. \"Personally, it will take me some time to get over this setback. I have been involved in professional football, as either a player or manager, since I was . Now, I plan to take some time with my family as I prepare for the next opportunity in my journey as a manager.\" The club said its professional development coach Steve Spooner will take charge on an interim basis. Prior to his stint with DC United, Rooney had a month spell in charge of Derby County where his team collected points enough for survival but were relegated to the third tier after a points deduction amid financial trouble.",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Tottenham Hotspur's Cristian Romero will miss at least a month's action due to a hamstring injury and the Premier League club may need to sign another centre back as backup, manager Ange Postecoglou said on Wednesday. Argentina international Romero came off at halftime during their weekend home victory over Everton. Spurs are now without their two best central defenders with Dutchman Micky van de Ven sidelined since early November and not expected to return until next month. \"No, no. He's no good. He's had a scan, so he'll be out for four or five weeks,\" Postecoglou said of Romero's absence ahead of Thursday's Premier League trip to Brighton Hove Albion. \"Everyone else got through it okay. There's a few sore bodies there but we've had a, sort of, easier training week, last few days anyway, but everyone else is okay.\" James Maddison, Ivan Perisic, Ryan Sessegnon, Manor Solomon, Rodrigo Bentancur and Ashley Phillips are the other longterm absentees in the Tottenham squad. Postecoglou said Van de Ven could return for their trip to Manchester United on Jan. and acknowledged they need another centre back to provide some backup in that position. \"I don't put as much stock into the leftsided or rightsided centre back scenario, we just need another player in that position who can provide some more depth for us and the ability to change it up,\" he said. \"It is more the profile and characteristics. We didn't go looking for a leftsided centre back at the start of the year, it just happened that Micky was the perfect centre back. \"It is about looking at the right profile, the right characteristics and seeing what is available, then going from there.\" Postecoglou was also full of admiration for Brighton and how the southcoast club is managed by Roberto De Zerbi. Brighton are ninth in the league and through to the Europa League knockout stage in their first season in Europe. \"Their football is fantastic, they do things a little differently to everyone else,\" Postecoglou said. \"They're a very well run club, they have been for quite a while ... Roberto's come in and he's always done things fairly unique in his career and he's brought that to the Premier League. You've got to respect that. \"This is probably the toughest league in the world and it's easy to shy away from doing anything that's too different. But you can tell he's determined to do things his own way.\"",

Despite holding possession and taking shots with eight on target, Arsenal failed to score against their sixthplaced London rivals at home on Thursday. They also registered touches in the West Ham box, the most for a team in the top flight that failed to score since . Last season's runnersup now sit two points behind leaders Liverpool at the halfway stage of the campaign. \"There's no panic, it's about trying to do more and do better and win games,\" Arteta told reporters. \"If the team is playing like this, then you're going to go and win a lot of games. \"If we don't improve in the boxes, then no we won't win the league. Because, in the end, that the West Ham result is what it is. \"But generating the rest, it was a record. So I don't think there are many teams in the league who have done that over many years, so it's something positive I think.\" Arsenal's next match is against Fulham, who are off the back of three straight defeats, on Sunday. While the schedule might be packed, Arteta insisted his players remain \"fresh\". \"They are young, if they are , then maybe it's a different question. But they have a lot of energy and can keep going, that's for sure,\" the Spaniard said. \"Without a spark, you don't generate what the team generated against West Ham. It is the final thing, the final touch, the final touch that puts the ball in the back of the net or not. That's what we need.\"",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe struck a long awaited deal on Sunday to buy a stake in Manchester United and pledged to invest million in the English Premier League soccer club to try to revive its fortunes. The deal, which will also see Ratcliffe's INEOS group take over management of the club's soccer operations, ends more than a year of uncertainty after majority owners, the Glazer family, said in November they were looking at strategic options. The Glazers have come under heavy criticism from fans for presiding over a decline in the club's performance since former manager Alex Ferguson retired in following a period of unprecedented success. \"As a local boy and a lifelong supporter of the club, I am very pleased that we have been able to agree a deal with the Manchester United Board that delegates us management responsibility of the football operations of the club,\" Ratcliffe, , said in a statement. \"Whilst the commercial success of the club has ensured there have always been available funds to win trophies at the highest level, this potential has not been fully unlocked in recent times. \"We will bring the global knowledge, expertise and talent from the wider INEOS Sport group to help drive further improvement at the Club, while also providing funds intended to enable future investment into Old Trafford.\" Ratcliffe's stake purchase at per share values the times English champions at . billion including debt, a source familiar with the matter said. The club said million of Ratcliffe's planned investment would be paid on closing of the deal, and a further million by the end of . Qatar's Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al Thani had also looking at buying the club, but dropped out of the process, saying he would not raise his billion offer. Ratcliffe's INEOS also owns French Ligue club Nice, Swiss Super League side FC LausanneSport, and works with Racing Club Abidjan of Ivory Coast Ligue One. It is also behind the Grenadiers, one of the world's most successful cycling teams. \"Sir Jim and INEOS bring a wealth of commercial experience as well as significant financial commitment into the club,\" United's executive chairs Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer said. \"And, through INEOS Sport, Manchester United will have access to seasoned highperformance professionals, experienced in creating and leading elite teams from both inside and outside the game.\" Since Ferguson stepped down, United have cycled through five permanent managers and three caretakers but failed to recapture the glory days, winning one FA Cup, two League Cup trophies and a Europa League title in years. The Glazers' adamant stance on not selling the club over the years has become a source of frustration for the fans who clamoured for change and held protests as the club's net debt soared to over million. The Manchester United Supporters Trust MUST welcomed the investment from Ratcliffe but questioned the new structure that will be put in place and demanded a meeting with the INEOS team to understand its plans. \"We note the statements that he and his team will control sporting activities, yet puzzle how any organisation can put its very core business in the hands of a minority shareholder, and how that meaningfully works in practice,\" MUST said in a statement. \"It is now incumbent on the club's owners and management to properly explain how this new structure will work, where the new investment will be directed and how it will benefit the team on the field.\" Under Dutch coach Erik ten Hag, United are eighth in the Premier League table points off the top despite a transfer outlay of nearly billion euros . billion in the last six years. They were also knocked out of European competitions after finishing last in their Champions League group. \"We are here for the long term and recognise that a lot of challenges and hard work lie ahead,\" Ratcliffe added. \"Our shared ambition is clear we all want to see Manchester United back where we belong, at the very top of English, European and world football.\" . euros",

F. and Carlo Ancelotti have agreed to extend our coach's contract until June , ,\" Real said in a statement. His contract was due to expire in , and this extension ends speculation that Ancelotti would take over as manager of Brazil. In March of this year, then Brazilian FA CBF president Ednaldo Rodrigues that Ancelotti was his main target for the position of national team coach. In July, when introducing caretaker manager Fernando Diniz, he remained confident \"He Ancelotti will be here, ,\" Rodrigues said. Ancelotti, the only manager to have won a title in all of Europe's big five leagues, had previously refused to speak about his plans. \"I'll give you the chance to ask another question,\" Ancelotti told a reporter at a press conference before Real's Champions League match against Napoli last month, when asked if he would be at the club for another season. Earlier this month, Rodrigues was from his post by a Rio de Janeiro court which annulled an assembly of the organisation held in in which Rodrigues was elected to lead the CBF until . The president of the Superior Court of Sports Justice Jose Perdiz was named interim head, and sources told Reuters that CBFs political situation and uncertainty was a key factor for Ancelottis decision to accept the Real Madrid offer. Real lead LaLiga standings on goal difference ahead of Girona after games, and their next game sees them host Mallorca on Wednesday.",

An thminute penalty earned and converted by substitute Noni Madueke unleashed a wave of relief around the stadium where fans have endured a hugely disappointing , despite massive spending on new players by Chelsea's U.S. owners. Crystal Palace's Michael Olise had punished Chelsea at the end of the first half when he took advantage of lax marking to equalise, cancelling out winger Mykhailo Mudryk's simple finish from a cross by defender Malo Gusto in the th minute. The win was the third in a row at home in the Premier League for Chelsea after victories over Sheffield United and Brighton Hove Albion, ending a long run of poor home form that stretched back into last season. But those victories have contrasted with away defeats at Newcastle United, Manchester United, Everton and Wolverhampton Wanderers, leaving Chelsea firmly stuck in midtable. At this stage last season, when Graham Potter was in charge, they sat in the same th spot, a far cry from the form that saw them crowned champions of Europe in . Pochettino said he expected more from his expensively assembled side which featured France striker Christopher Nkunku making his first start and Romeo Lavia who came off the bench for his debut. \"The Premier League is really tough and we need to be consistent,\" the Argentine told the BBC. \"The first half of the season has been really up and down and it's been tough and difficult. But we're positive and we need to show that we can compete.\" Pochettino praised Madueke for overcoming his disappointment at not featuring much for Chelsea to come off the bench and play a decisive role in the win. \"We are not a charity,\" he told reporters. \"We are a football club and we need to perform...The first thing is to have the right mentality and to go there on the pitch and to show respect to the history of the club.\" Palace manager Roy Hodgson acknowledged his team's position just three points off the relegation area posed a risk but he took comfort from the performances of his players even if they are now without a win in eight league matches. \"We aren't winning matches at the moment. If weren't showing the spirit we are showing, that would be more of a concern,\" Hodgson told Amazon Prime. \"It hurts that we are near the bottom of the table.\"",

On Sunday, FIFA that the Club World Cup will feature teams and will be played every four years from . The governing body also announced a new Intercontinental Cup which will be played annually and will have the UEFA Champions League winner playing in the final against a team that comes through intercontinental playoffs. The announcement drew criticism from the global players' union FIFPRO as well as the World Leagues Forum WLF over increased player workload and health risks. Wenger countered the criticism by saying that the revamped format of the Club World Cup would increase resources for clubs around the world. \"In Europe we are lucky, but it's important that we make football really global and this creates a chance for other clubs to progress, this is the real target,\" the former Arsenal manager added. \"It will give more opportunities to more players all over the world to compete at the highest level... \"I accept that the football calendar is a busy one, but this is a competition that is going to take place every four years and of course the rest period during the competition and afterwards has to be respected.\" Wenger also pointed to improvements in medicine in recent years, saying player welfare and injury prevention had \"increased dramatically\". \"It is unrecognisable from what it used to be. Also VAR has helped with the protection of players, as players know they cannot escape from making bad tackles that cause injury,\" Wenger said. \"So overall there has been huge improvements on the welfare side, and we want to continue with that progress.\" The current version of the Club World Cup an annual competition with seven teams will be discontinued after the tournament now being hosted by Saudi Arabia.",

      "article_body": "MILAN, Dec Reuters Goals from Yann Bisseck and Nicolo Barella gave Inter Milan a home win over Lecce in Serie A on Saturday to restore their fourpoint lead at the top of the table. Inter lead the standings on points after games, four points ahead of Juventus who beat Frosinone on Saturday. Lecce remained th with points. Lecce looked like keeping Inter scoreless until the break but Yann Bisseck netted his first goal for the club in the rd minute when he headed home a free kick whipped in by Hakan Calhanoglu. The yearold defender had earlier thumped a volley onto the crossbar from a corner. Four minutes after the interval Lecce thought they had a penalty, but a VAR check overruled the referee's decision for a handball offence. After sustained pressure from Lecce in the second half, the home side finally found a second goal in the th minute when Barella combined with Marko Arnautovic to settle the Inter nerves. The pair played a onetwo and Marko Arnautovic produced a backheel to put the ball into the path of Barella all alone in front of the keeper and he calmly took a touch before slotting his effort past Wladimiro Falcone. \"He made an unbelievable assist, I'm not surprised because in terms of understanding with his back to goal, he's one of the best players I've played with,\" Barella told Inter TV. An injury to Inter's leading scorer Lautaro Martinez gave Arnautovic his first Serie A start of the season, and while his search for a first league goal with Inter continues, he redeemed some early misses with the assist for Barella. After the goal, a visibly emotional Arnautovic fell to his knees and was swarmed by his team mates. \"They know I am in a difficult moment, we speak every day. I started the season with an assist, but then I remained six weeks out,\" Arnautovic told DAZN. \"It's been difficult to recover, but now I am getting close to my best. They see it, they talk to me every day, but it's not an easy moment. I can only thank the club, my team mates and the fans.\" Lecce went down to men in the rd minute when Lameck Banda was shown a red card for dissent, and Inter pushed on for more goals but were denied by a fantastic doublesave by Falcone on Benjamin Pavard and Kristjan Asllani two minutes from time. Inter, knocked out of the Coppa Italia on Wednesday by Bologna, notched their fourth consecutive league win and Simone Inzaghi's side are now unbeaten in Serie A games. Lecce lost for the first time in six matches.",

I can't wait to get started, and I'm ready to work to make the dream of winning more titles with this great club a reality,\" Suarez said in a statement. Suarez and Messi were part of the famous Barca attacking trio along with Brazilian forward Neymar which dominated Spain and Europe in the season when they won LaLiga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League. Suarez first made a splash in Europe with Ajax Amsterdam before making the switch to Premier League side Liverpool where he scored goals. But it was at Barcelona where he was most successful when he scored goals and made assists. When Barca had no more use for him, he made the switch to rivals Atletico Madrid, where he continued to impress and led the team to a LaLiga title. In all, he has scored more than senior goals for club and country in a career spanning nearly two decades. \"Luis is an outstanding striker with a track record of excellence at the very top levels of the sport,\" Chief Soccer Officer and Sporting Director Chris Henderson said. \"He has proven himself to be a singular talent in every league he's played in over the course of his career thus far.\" Miami won the Leagues Cup in following Messi's arrival but did not qualify for the MLS Cup playoffs.

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Argentina centreback German Pezzella's strike from a rebound late in the second half helped Real Betis hold surprise LaLiga leaders Girona to a draw on Thursday. The surprise pack of the Spanish season extended their lead on top of the LaLiga standings to points but lost a golden opportunity to secure going into winter break alone in top spot. Secondplaced Real Madrid could cut their threepoint deficit and level Girona on top if they win at lowly Alaves later on Thursday. Girona's stunning start to the LaLiga season scaled new heights with their first win ever over two weeks ago, with their defeat at home to Real Madrid in late September, the only major blip in a stunning start to the campaign. On Thursday, however, they were unable to display the same intensity they have shown this season and were mostly dominated by a sturdy Betis who are unbeaten at home in LaLiga this campaign. Manuel Pellegrini's side are seventh in the LaLiga standings. They were better throughout the game, held most of the possession and wasted two great chances early on with Ayose Perez and Assane Diao missing from closerange. Girona goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga made a brilliant onehanded save to deny a Willian Carvalho shot from the edge of the box in the th minute. After Brazilian winger Savinho was brought down by a sliding tackle from Betis defender Aitor Ruibal, Ukrainian Artem Dovbyk netted the penalty by wrongfooting the goalkeeper with a tidy finish to the right in the th minute. The hosts managed to find the equaliser in the th minute with Pezzella's unstoppable strike from just inside the box making the most of a loose ball in a crowded area after a corner. \"Suffering a late goal hurts, we thought we had it,\" Girona midfielder Aleix Garcia told Movistar Plus. \"We are going on holidays satisfied, the dynamic is very good and now we have to recharge our batteries for what's to come.\"",

Rooney was appointed Birmingham manager in October when the club were sixth in the secondtier Championship, but was sacked this week after they won just two of his games in charge and fell to th, six points above the relegation zone. \"He's got an outstanding football brain and was a magnificent footballer,\" Hodgson, who coached Rooney during his tenure as England manager, told reporters on Wednesday ahead of Palace's FA Cup game against Everton on Thursday. \"I'm sad that it happened but I know he will bounce back. I read he will take a little break from the game. That's an intelligent thing to do. \"There's no doubt that Wayne Rooney will always be on people's lips and minds when it comes to future jobs. He really does understand football. He's proved that as a player he was very thoughtful and astute tactically.\" Rooney is among a number of former England players to have struggled in managerial roles in recent years, with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard having unsuccessful spells at Everton and Aston Villa. Hodgson said explayers are often judged severely after being appointed to top roles. \"They will be welcomed into a club because of their name and they will be expected to suddenly take over a team that hasn't been doing brilliantly and make it fly,\" he added. \"That's an unrealistic demand. They all have to say they didn't really get a good chance. No one gave them two years, didn't give them three transfer windows, a chance.\"",

Forest appointed the former Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur manager after with Cooper following five defeats in six games which saw them slip to th in the table, five points above the relegation zone. Cooper joined Forest in September when the club were bottom and helped them earn promotion when they finished fourth and won the playoffs. He also managed to keep them in the top flight last season when they finished th and remained a popular figure, with fans chanting his name even when they lost to Fulham. \"What Steve did here was huge... We are trying to improve this legacy, which is amazing,\" Nuno told reporters at his first news conference as Forest manager. \"It shows how good the Forest fans are, the respect they have for Steve even though things didn't go well this season.\" Nuno spent four seasons at Wolves and helped get them promoted to the Premier League in his first season there. The former Porto player and manager then took over at Spurs in June where he won his first three games in charge and even picked up a Manager of the Month award for August. However, their season quickly unravelled as they lost five of their seven games before he was replaced by Antonio Conte. Nuno was then appointed manager of Saudi Arabian club AlIttihad and led them to their first league title in years, only to be sacked last month after a run of five league games without a win. The Portuguese manager took charge of his first training session earlier on Wednesday and said he was happy with what he saw from the squad, adding that those who did not get much playing time would receive a second chance. \"What I saw today gives me assurance that we are in a good way in terms of happiness,\" he said. \"In terms of numbers, I have to be honest with you, I never managed a squad of players. That part is a challenge for us also.\" Nuno's first game in charge will be at home on Saturday against Bournemouth, who have moved up to th and have a game in hand. \"It's going to be tough, they've improved a lot recently so we expect a tough game,\" Nuno said. \"But we play at the City Ground and the help of our fans is going to be very important.\"",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Sport and politics would ideally never mix but as the world becomes increasingly divided on societal issues, sporting platforms have turned into lightning rods for social activism. Be it athletes or spectators, disobedience or disruption has been the order of the day as they attempt to transcend the boundaries of the arena and convey their views to millions of people worldwide. When Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the U.S. national anthem at NFL games to protest against racial injustice in , little did he know the butterfly effect his deed would have as it sparked debates and polarised a country. But his gesture has since been embraced by top leagues around the world, none more so than England's Premier League European soccer's most lucrative and popular competition. A spillover from the Black Lives Matter movement that began over three years ago, the league's players continue to fight discrimination by taking a knee before some games this season. \"We are unified in our belief that any form of discrimination has no place within football or wider society,\" the Premier League captains said earlier this year. \"We are committed to using our platform to help celebrate diversity and show our support in the fight against racism.\" The continued protests are, to a large extent, to do with rampant online abuse which rears its ugly head every week, with social media platforms seemingly unable to stem the flow of unbridled rage and racial abuse that lands in players' inboxes. Outside the arena, Olympic medalwinning wrestlers in India found out the hard way what lies in store for those who leverage their popularity to go up against a member of the ruling party after months of protests on the streets fell on deaf ears. India's top wrestlers were by police in May when they intensified their protest demanding the arrest of their federation chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over allegations of sexual harassment of female athletes, which he denied. As images of wrestlers being manhandled by police were beamed across the world, Olympic bronze medallist Sakshi Malik said \"This is how our champions are being treated. The world is watching us.\" On the other hand, sporting platforms have also been a stage for spectators to amplify causes and was no different in dividing viewers when activists disrupted major events from tennis Grand Slams to golf majors and cricket matches. Just Stop Oil protesters interrupted Wimbledon matches when they released orange tickertape onto the grasscourt surface while the group also stopped play by scattering orange powder at an Ashes test and the World Snooker Championship. Their controversial and disruptive tactics have been condemned by athletes and fans alike, but they also garnered sympathy from popular and outspoken soccer pundit Gary Lineker. \"I completely understand where they're coming from, disruptive protest is the only one that gets any publicity. I get it,\" said Lineker, who presents BBC's 'Match of the Day' soccer highlights programme. \"I also understand why people get so upset with it, particularly in sport. I think what is more important is probably our existence in the future rather than slight disruption of sporting events.\" U.S. Open tennis champion Coco Gauff, who has spoken out on various causes, also has no qualms about such protests even though disrupted her semifinal at Flushing Meadows and one glued his feet to the stand's concrete floor. \"I think that moments like this are historydefining moments,\" Gauff said. \"If that's what they felt they needed to do to get their voices heard, I can't really get upset at it.\"",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Champions League holders Manchester City are taking nothing for granted as they seek to complete their trophy cabinet by winning the Club World Cup, manager Pep Guardiola said on Monday ahead of his side's semifinal meeting with Urawa Red Diamonds. City, who won their first Champions League title this year, are yet to win the Club World Cup, a trophy Guardiola won twice with Barcelona and once with Bayern Munich. \"It's a pleasure to be here, it's the first time Man City is here. We don't take it for granted, it's a privilege, an honour to be here,\" Guardiola told reporters. \"We know how hard it is to win this competition and you have to have done something special in the past... It is my fourth time I have played this competition and the previous times the semifinal was really tough, really tricky every time. \"We want to win it. Once we are here, it is a trophy we do not have. We want to close the little circle and win all the trophies we could do. This is the last one.\" The last editions of the Club World Cup have been won by European sides and City will be firm favourites when they take on Asian Champions League holders Urawa at King Abdullah Sports City Stadium in Jeddah on Tuesday. However, Guardiola urged caution, pointing to the strength of Japanese football, with Japan's national team, the 'Samurai Blue', having recorded wins over Spain and Germany in last year's World Cup. \"To reach the final is tricky. We don't know them much, we got as much information as possible,\" Guardiola said. \"Japan's national team is beating Germany, winning games against the best in the world. Football in Japan is strong.\" City are in a poor run of form heading into the contest, having won just three of their last eight matches in all competitions, but midfielder Bernardo Silva said the team are not lacking in desire. \"When you play the Club World Cup there is no tiredness. We are motivated to come here and play the competition,\" Silva added. \"Almost all of us never won and as a club we never won and we want to do it. First we have to play Urawa Red Diamonds and we will prepare well to do it.\"",

After hitting the woodwork early in the game through Castello Lukeba, Leipzig, with captain Emil Forsberg playing his last game before moving to the MLS in the United States in January, went in front when Lois Openda struck two minutes into the second half. The Belgium international needed three consecutive efforts to beat Werder keeper Michael Zetterer who blocked his first two shots before he stabbed the ball in for his th goal of the campaign. Werder also hit the crossbar through Marvin Duksch in the th minute before Zetterer, outstanding throughout, came to the rescue once more, denying Openda in a oneonone as he attempted to round the keeper. The hosts grabbed the equaliser in the th with a sensational metre strike from Justin Njinmah. Leipzig, who take on Real Madrid in the Champions League round of in February, are third on points, two ahead of fourthplaced VfB Stuttgart, who are in action against Augsburg on Wednesday. The league will then break until Jan. .",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Gary O'Neil has joined a long list of Premier League managers complaining about the packed football schedule, including three games in six days for his side with a rare Christmas Eve fixture. While most European leagues are on a break over the yearend period, Wolves are gearing up for a particularly busy week, even by PL standards. \"Most teams have eight days to play their three games and ours has been trimmed at either end so just six days,\" O'Neil told reporters on Friday. \"Weve still got a few injury issues with a squad not overly big, so trying to plan minutes and who might play what is probably not the best way to do it with this group,\" he said. \"Well take every game as it comes.\" After hosting Chelsea, thplaced Wolves visit Brentford and then welcome Everton, all before the year is out. \"Well see where we end up with the lads fatiguewise and injurywise, and then move into Brentford and see where we are again,\" O'Neil said. The Premier League said there would be next season when it announced the fixture dates on Friday. But the crammed schedule and its impact on player welfare is a serious concern for managers such as Liverpool's Juergen Klopp. \"Yesterday we were out for recovery and a little bit of training,\" Klopp said on Friday, reeling off the team's routine in reverse. \"We played Wednesday. Tuesday shorter than normal session, set pieces and tactical stuff, minutes. Monday recovery. Sunday game. Saturday, MD matchday minus one, minutes max. Friday recovery. Thursday game.\" Liverpool face leaders Arsenal on Saturday, followed by a Tuesday fixture at Burnley. \"I saw that West Ham play at tomorrow. You have to ask the question, is that right You're playing a competition where each team should get the same treatment,\" Klopp said. \"We play at pm tomorrow, that means the boys sleep longer. West Ham get up at and at they throw in the noodles How is that fair Why can't they look at that, whoever is doing it \"For once, put your club shirt away and just think about general football problems. Somebody has to change,\" he added.",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Melbourne Victory coach Tony Popovic praised his club's ability to bounce back from a damaging bout of highprofile fan violence months ago to end the year on top of the ALeague standings. Victory's reputation was tarnished in December when a pitch invasion during a derby match with Melbourne City resulted in goalkeeper Tom Glover being hit in the face with a metal bucket and officials abandoning the game. The club was handed a A, fine by football authorities as well as a suspended point deduction following the incident, which garnered global headlines days after Australia's national team had reached the knockout rounds of the World Cup. The episode was a low point in a dismal campaign for the fourtimes ALeague champions, who finished th in the team standings to prompt an endofseason review that Popovic believes has put the club back on track. \"Adversity makes you stronger,\" Popovic told reporters, after a win over Adelaide United on Saturday ensured Victory would go into the New Year at the ALeague summit. \"You become tough, hardened from tough experiences and that's what we went through as a football club in a very difficult period. But we've come out the other side with renewed energy. \"It started straight after the season finished with a real vision and goal of what we wanted to achieve as a club and change the narrative, get people speaking about Victory in a positive manner.\" Victory's form so far this season has had the desired effect, with Popovic's outfit the only remaining unbeaten team in the division. Saturday's win at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium came via late goals from Zinedine Machach and Bruno Fornaroli, leaving Victory ahead of Wellington Phoenix on goal difference. \"It is a special club,\" said Popovic. \"We had a clear vision and a goal to be competing and challenging for honours that this famous club always does. That's been our goal. \"We still haven't achieved that. Yes, we're top but it's only games in. But we're on track as a football club and what's great is that everyone in the changing room, everyone in the heirarchy, understands that there's a lot of work to do. \"We enjoy these little moments, you have to, it's special and we'll reflect with fondness how it's finished and know that 's a big year and without the sacrifice and hard work no one gives you anything in this league. You have to earn it. \"Where we are now, we've earnt. We want more of it, but we understand we will have to work hard for it. We're willing to do that to give ourselves a chance.\"",

Milan, also out of the Champions League, already look to be out of the title race after losing four matches this season. While Italian media reported that defeat on Saturday could lead to his sacking, Pioli disagreed. \"We need a win. I expect a convincing performance,\" Pioli told a press conference. \"Tomorrow's game isn't about me, nor is it do or die, there's still a long way to go in the season. Milan must win tomorrow because we need the points. We cannot expect to make up for everything tomorrow.\" Milan won the Serie A title with a win at Sassuolo in , but Pioli is also aware that his team have lost the last three meetings between the sides at the San Siro. \"We've studied Sassuolo, they are a side that builds from the back and creates chances. We need to be aware of Domenico Berardi and Armand Lauriente, in particular,\" Pioli said. \"But they also concede a lot too, so we'll have to take advantage of their frailties, especially in defence. Sassuolo have beaten Inter and Juventus, which means they know how to play certain games, and possess quality.\" Milan have struggled with injuries this season, which may go some way to explaining why they have been unable to put together a winning run to keep pace with the league leaders. \"Our flaw is that we haven't had consistency. The new signings are strong players, but then it's normal that it takes time to adapt to the Italian league,\" the manager said. \"It's not the best league, but it's certainly the most complicated in terms of tactics and pressure.\" Milan are third in the standings, on points after games, seven behind Juventus in second and just two ahead of Bologna in fourth. Sassuolo are th with points.",

Ratcliffe will take a stake in United and pledged to invest million in the club to try to revive their fortunes. The deal is subject to a regulatory signoff. United have not won the league since and although there is hope Ratcliffe can turn things around when he is given the responsibility of football operations, the yearold said there was no quick fix. \"I believe we can bring sporting success on the pitch to complement the undoubted commercial success that the club has enjoyed,\" Ratcliffe said in an open letter to the Manchester United Supporters Trust. \"It will require time and patience alongside rigour and the highest level of professional management. \"You are ambitious for Manchester United and so are we. There are no guarantees in sport, and change can inevitably take time but we are in it for the long term.\" United have fallen to eighth in the standings after eight defeats in games this season. \"There's a feeling that a full takeover would have been preferable clearly, and so there's some concern about that, and is this just the new limbo that we get into\" Duncan Drasdo, the CEO of Manchester United Supporters Trust, said before Tuesday's game against Aston Villa at Old Trafford.",

      "article_body": "BIRMINGHAM, England, Dec Reuters An thminute penalty from Douglas Luiz earned Aston Villa a hardfought home victory over man Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday, provisionally moving Unai Emery's side to second place in the table. Villa moved up to points from games, level with league leaders Liverpool and two ahead of Arsenal and champions Manchester City all of whom are yet to play this weekend. Burnley remained in th place. \"\"We are in the big club, we deserve it. We work every day so hard. Everyone is so happy, we need to enjoy the moment,\" Villa midfielder Luiz said. After a defeat and a draw in their last two matches, Villa began well, as Ollie Watkins forced Burnley keeper James Trafford into a sharp save before setting up Leon Bailey, who fired into the roof of the net to break the deadlock in the th minute. Burnley responded three minutes later when Dara O'Shea headed a free kick across goal towards Zeki Amdouni, who volleyed in at the far post to level the scores. A simple finish from Moussa Diaby put the hosts back ahead in the nd minute, with Watkins again involved as he sprung Burnley's offside trap and provided the assist in the final twist of an endtoend first half. Burnley looked brighter after the break and created several chances, but were dealt a massive blow when Sander Berge was sent off after being shown a second yellow card for a tug on Luiz's shirt. Villa turned up the pressure as they sought to extend their lead, but a string of chances went begging before they were given an almighty scare late on as Burnley levelled through Lyle Foster's smash and grab effort. Burnley defended with tenacity to delay the inevitable, but Villa's advantage ultimately proved too great and the home fans breathed a sigh of relief after Luiz hammered his spotkick off the underside of the crossbar and into the net following Aaron Ramsey's foul on Jhon Duran. \"I just tried to score. It is hard because at that moment the result is ,\" Luiz said. \"The last three games we don't play so well. It is halfway through the season, the players are tired, we lost three or four players to injury. It is difficult but we need to keep going.\" Luiz's late strike sealed Villa's ninth home victory this season and took their tally of home wins for up to more than any other team in the Premier League.",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters AC Milan's Stefano Pioli is a manager under pressure after last weekend's draw at Salernitana saw his side lose ground on league leaders Inter Milan, and they now face a vital game against Sassuolo. A th minute Luka Jovic goal salvaged Milan a draw at bottomoftable Salernitana, leaving them points adrift of Inter and seven off Juventus in second. Their third place is now under serious threat. Fourthplaced Bologna, who have lost just two games this season compared to Milan's four defeats, are now only two points behind, with Fiorentina a further point back. Sassuolo arrive at the San Siro on Saturday, and while they may not be a side in the best of form right now, this season has proven they can mix it with the best of them. A run of four games without a win, taking just one point in the process, leaves them in th place with points from games, and lie just three points above the relegation zone, but Milan would do well to look beyond these statistics. Sassuolo have won just four league games, but two of those came against Juventus and Inter, the only defeats suffered by the top two, and the win over the league leaders Inter came at the San Siro. Manager Alessio Dionisi will hope to have Domenico Berardi back when they face Milan, after their leading scorer missed the loss to Genoa last weekend through illness, but the Sassuolo coach's injury problems are nothing compared to Pioli's. Since the beginning of the season Milan have had different injuries, with of those caused by muscle problems, numbers which have put the manager's preparations and training methods under scrutiny. The latest out is defender Fikayo Tomori, injured during the draw with Salernitana, and with Milan already without Malick Thiaw and Pierre Kalulu at the back, the January transfer window may bring some relief for Pioli, if he is still in charge. Pioli is now in his fifth season at the club, and while the Scudetto won in , Milan's first league title in over a decade, has earned him a certain amount of credit with the owners, patience may run out, especially with the fans. A Champions League exit, albeit in a tough group containing Paris St Germain, Borussia Dortmund and Newcastle United, certainly did not help his cause, and the fact that Milan already look out of the title race is a serious cause for concern. According to Italian media reports, Antonio Conte could be the man to replace Pioli should the club decide to take action. Inter have a fourpoint lead over Juventus at the top and on Friday they travel to face thplaced Genoa, who won at Sassuolo last weekend and held Juventus to a draw the week before. Juventus host Roma on Saturday, with Jose Mourinho's side now in sixth place after their win over Napoli last weekend. Napoli will look to bounce back when they welcome Monza on Friday, as Walter Mazzarri has now suffered five defeats in his eight games in all competitions since taking over from Rudi Garcia in November. They will be without Victor Osimhen and Matteo Politano, both sent off against Roma. Bologna aim to preserve their topfour place when they travel to take on Udinese on Saturday, a side with just one win all season and one point above the relegation zone, but they have recorded draws.",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters The European Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that European soccer's governing body UEFA and its global counterpart FIFA breached EU law when they prevented clubs from forming a European Super League ESL. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus plus nine other European major clubs announced the breakaway ESL a closed league in April . Sports development company A assisted with creating the ESL. But the move collapsed within hours after an outcry from fans, governments and players forced Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid to pull out. A CEO Bernd Reichart said the ESL wanted to break what he described was a monopoly of competitions run by UEFA, which has organised European competitions for nearly years and sees the ESL as a significant threat. When the breakaway clubs were threatened with sanctions, the ESL went to court claiming that UEFA and FIFA held a monopoly position which was in breach of the European Union's Competition and Free Movement Law. Despite nine clubs pulling out, the three holdouts Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus still hoped to get the ESL up and running. However, Juventus opted to pull out earlier this year when the Italian club's board changed. Real and Barca took the case to a Spanish court, which subsequently sought guidance from the Luxembourgbased European Court. The Court said UEFA and FIFA by preventing the formation of a Super League and that they abused their dominant position by forbidding clubs to compete in the ESL. The court said that both regulating and organising sporting competitions was not an infringement of EU competition law and that sports federations can refuse third parties access to the market, but only if the refusal is justified by genuine objectives. The court added that at this moment \"there is no framework for FIFA and UEFA rules ensuring that they are transparent, objective, nondiscriminatory and proportionate\". The court's ruling said both bodies must \"comply with the competition rules and respect the freedoms of movement\", adding that their rules on approval, control and sanctions amounted to unjustified restrictions on the freedom to provide services. \"The Court observes that the organisation of interclub football competitions and the exploitation of the media rights are, quite evidently, economic activities,\" it said. \"They must therefore comply with the competition rules and respect the freedoms of movement.\" However, the court said the judgement did not necessarily mean the ESL project must be approved. That is for the Spanish court to decide. In this case, the Court of Justice only interpreted European Union law or the validity of a European Union act, it did not decide the dispute itself. The verdict means European clubs can join another continental league without the threat of sanctions instead of playing in competitions run solely by UEFA. Soon after the verdict, A released another proposal for with men's and women's teams playing midweek matches in a league system across Europe. Although the initial Super League project was a closed competition, the new one would see clubs participate based on sporting merit with no permanent members. The clubs would also stay in their respective domestic leagues. However, there is no guarantee the Premier League clubs will sign up for the new competition. Two months after the six English clubs pulled out of the project in , they said they would pay a combined million pounds . million as \"a gesture of goodwill\". They face a point deduction if they attempt a similar move in future while the Premier League also said they would each be fined million pounds if they attempt another breakaway. . pounds",

Most soccer leagues separate teams that are tied on points by goal difference the difference between goals scored and goals conceded, but the ALeague's new rules prioritise the number of wins a team has. With Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix level on points, the Victoriabased club were listed in top spot on the ALeague's website thanks to their superior goal difference, despite the New Zealand outfit having one more win. After a fan's post on the social medial platform X, formerly known as Twitter, pointed out that Phoenix should be top of the standings according to the ALeague's new rules, the league updated the table on its website. In a statement on Tuesday, the Aleague said the rule change had been communicated to clubs in the offseason and that it had been made to \"encourage more attacking football and to increase the number of matches that matter through the season\". \"A technical error which has now been rectified had led to the league tables showing incorrectly on aleagues.com.au for the opening rounds of the season.\" Former Blackburn Rovers and West Ham United player Slater said there was no reason for the ALeague to change the rule. \"The whole point is you just stick to what the rest of world are doing, there is a good reason for it,\" Slater told News Corp. \"If you look at things that might be wrong with the ALeague, and there's a lot you can pick from, that is not one of them. Why muck around with what the rest of the world does ... Don't fix what's not broken.\"",

When asked if competition organisers risk killing football, Molango said \"I think that the players are ready now to take a strong stance. \"I do think that the authorities who are supposed to protect the players and protect the games are not doing that. They are generating more competitions, generating more income to the detriment of the players.\" He added that the current calendar makes it \"physically, humanly impossible\" for the players to perform at their best level.",

      "article_body": "WOLVERHAMPTON, Dec Reuters Wolverhampton Wanderers continued their stellar home form to heap misery on Chelsea on Christmas eve with a win in the Premier League on Sunday, thanks to secondhalf strikes from Mario Lemina and Matt Doherty. After a goalless first half, Lemina headed in a Pablo Sarabia corner six minutes after halftime to give Wolves the lead before Doherty secured the win with a second goal in added time while Christopher Nkunku scored his first goal for Chelsea. Wolves, who are unbeaten at home in the league since September, moved up to th with points, level with thplaced Chelsea but trailing the London side on goal difference. Chelsea have now lost four away games in a row as Mauricio Pochettino's side fell to their eighth league defeat of the season. \"We feel very disappointed because we deserve much more. We are not clinical enough. We created chances and had the possession,\" Pochettino said. \"It is a young team and many players are in the Premier League for the first time. They need to adapt. We need to learn from these games. We are in a position Chelsea should not be in.\" Chelsea's best chance of the first half fell to Raheem Sterling who stole the ball from last man Joao Gomes and sprinted into the Wolves box with only the keeper Jose Sa to beat. Sterling went for the finish himself despite having two team mates including Cole Palmer unmarked to his right. The shot was blocked by Sa, laying waste to the threeonone opportunity. Chelsea paid for their wastefulness six minutes after halftime when Lemina was left poorly marked and his header from Pablo Sarabia's corner sailed into the net. \"It's amazing, the support we have here is fantastic. I hope we can keep pushing on and making the fans happy,\" Lemina told Sky Sports. Wolves doubled their lead when Benoit Badiashile failed to deal with Hugo Bueno's cross and an unmarked Matt Doherty guided his shot past Chelsea keeper Djordje Petrovic. \"The second goal was very important because they nicked a goal at the end. I tend to have a knack over my career of being in the right place at the right time and I slotted it away,\" Doherty said. \"The kind of atmosphere that's generated around the stadium. Our record against top six teams is good. We've beaten most of them here and away. We're doing really well.\" Christopher Nkunku netted a consolation goal for Chelsea, his first for the London club since his closeseason move, but they could not find an equaliser.",

      "article_body": "Dec Reuters Liverpool have exceeded expectations by topping the Premier League table at the halfway mark of the season but Manchester City will be optimistic of getting back into the title fight after Arsenal slipped up this month. Despite seeing their midfield gutted in the close season, Juergen Klopp's Liverpool have turned things around with a quick rebuild and lost only one game this season a defeat at Tottenham Hotspur marred by a . Liverpool have also managed to survive an injury crisis to top the league with the best defensive record but Klopp is not resting on his laurels yet, especially with top scorer Mohamed Salah off to the Africa Cup of Nations next month. \"We had a lot of injuries, some players not involved once who are key players for us. Both left backs aren't in, which is really not good,\" Klopp said. \"But we found a way to the next game and found a way to compete. It all starts with defending we don't concede all the time so we don't get desperate. \"So far it's ok. Better to be first than sixth.\" Klopp's side host a struggling, ninthplaced Newcastle United who have won just one of their last seven games in all competitions, with Eddie Howe's team also contending with several injuries. Newcastle have not beaten Liverpool since and have lost the last five encounters. \"We've had a couple of painful games against Liverpool but the positives from both of those games is that we've performed really well and we were competitive. We need to be near perfect in this game,\" Howe said. Arsenal were top at Christmas for a second straight season but lost the opportunity to leapfrog leaders Liverpool when they fell at home to West Ham United on Thursday, five days after a draw at Anfield. Mikel Arteta's side have won only one of their last four games to drop to second and a key factor for their struggles is goals drying up for their front three Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli. The trio have only three goals between them in the last five league games despite Arsenal creating numerous chances, especially at home. \"This is football, when the team generates that much normally you are going to win games,\" Arteta said. \"That's the way we've done it. Against Brighton, we generated so much, against Liverpool as well. But we score goals in different ways and we have to make another step in that area to win the game more comfortably.\" Their poor form gives newlycrowned world champions City who have a game in hand the chance to move up level with Arsenal when they host bottom side Sheffield United on Saturday. City are unbeaten at the Etihad in games and though the last three have been draws, they have a record against the Blades in six matches. Thirdplaced Aston Villa are the surprise package of the season and Unai Emery's side face relegationthreatened Burnley while fifthplaced Spurs host a resurgent Bournemouth who have points from their last seven games. Manchester United will also look to get their season back on track when they travel to Nottingham Forest, where new boss Nuno Espirito Santo had an almost immediate impact when they beat Newcastle at St. James' Park earlier this week.",

      "article_body": "LIVERPOOL, England, Dec Reuters Manchester City climbed back into the Premier League's top four as secondhalf goals by Phil Foden, Julian Alvarez and Bernardo Silva sealed a comeback victory at Everton on Wednesday. Pep Guardiola's newlycrowned FIFA World Club champions had lost ground in the title race after a run of one win in six league games, but they returned to domestic action to send out a warning to their rivals. Everton took the lead against the run of play through Jack Harrison's closerange finish in the th minute. But Foden drilled in a superb low shot after minutes and Alvarez converted a penalty after a handball awarded against Everton's Amadou Onana. Silva wrapped up the points four minutes from time with a sublime finish after a mistake by Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford although the win came at a cost with defender John Stones forced off due to a leg injury. Champions City moved above Tottenham Hotspur into fourth place with points from games, five behind leaders Liverpool having played a game less. Everton's second successive defeat after four straight wins left them one place and one point above the relegation zone, a position skewed by their point deduction. City's quest for an unprecedented fourth successive Premier League title hit turbulence before Christmas with defeat by Aston Villa, draws against Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace and an injury to Norwegian goal machine Erling Haaland. They were not in Premier League action last weekend as they headed back from Saudi Arabia having become world champions so victory was essential to close the gap on Liverpool. When Harrison stunned them by turning in Dwight McNeil's low ball across the area in a rare Everton attack it seemed more trouble was in store. Harrison was denied a second as City's keeper Ederson made a superb onehanded save but City recovered their poise thereafter to take control. \"I thought we played really well in the first half and it seems to have been the same story as previous games,\" Foden told Amazon Prime. \"The manager just said to believe in ourselves at halftime because we're a top team. \"In the second half, wow. I think we blew them away with the way they played.\" Foden produced a dazzling display and equalised with a sweetlystruck leftfoot shot that flew low past the dive of Pickford. City went ahead when Onana attempted to block a shot by Nathan Ake and the ball struck his arm from pointblank range the penalty being awarded by referee John Brooks after frenzied appeals by City's players and then confirmed by VAR. \"It's a farce where the laws are at the moment, it's bizarre decision in my world, but maybe I'm from a different planet,\" Everton manager Sean Dyche said. Dominic CalvertLewin spurned a great chance to equalise when he stabbed a shot wide from close range. City made sure of the win as Pickford took too long to make a clearance and his kick was deflected to Silva who curled the ball into the top corner of the empty goal. \"We know after six games with just one win, the people were asking, which is normal because it is all about results but we are close to Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa. We want to be there,\" Guardiola said.",

PSG qualified for the knockout stage placing second in Group F, while an unbeaten Sociedad topped Group D. \"I'm pleased with the draw because I really wanted to go back to Spain,\" the former Barcelona and Spain coach told reporters on Tuesday. \"We know Real Sociedad really well. They have lots of players who have been with Spain, in the national team with me. \"We know it will be difficult. They won a group that included Inter Milan who were finalists in the championship last season. And they still managed to finish top.\" Luis Enrique, who joined PSG in July, said he was still in the process of improving the squad to get the best out of them. \"I am very pleased with the first half of the season in terms of results,\" he said. \"We had such a difficult Champions League group. And in the end we've had good results also in the league. \"The most difficult part is still to be done in the second half of the season.\" PSG have a fivepoint lead at the top of the Ligue standings and face thplaced Metz on Wednesday. However, Luis Enrique warned his side not to be complacent against their opponents, who are coming off three straight losses. \"It will be a really difficult game... they will leave us with very little spaces to attack,\" he said. \"We will need to be very precise and accurate to exploit those spaces.\" The matchday will coincide with the birthday of Kylian Mbappe who has scored league goals for PSG, including this season from appearances. \"Kylian Mbappe is still very young at . He is the age of my son which is quite something,\" Luis Enrique said. \"I hope that Kylian Mbappe achieves so much more success both collectively and individually. We hope that will be here at PSG and we hope to help him develop.\"",

Trailing in Utrecht after minutes, Ajax looked to have saved themselves when Brian Brobbey and Chuba Akpom netted late goals to level the score. But Hercules netted the winner through Mats Grotenbreg in the third minute of injurytime after their own coach Rene van der Kooij had given his team a two percent chance of victory before the game. Ajax coach John van 't Schip was not present to witness his sides capitulation as he is in Australia to attend his sons wedding. It is the first time Ajax have lost to an amateur club in the Dutch Cup. In the previous meetings, they have scored at least four goals. Ajax spent the early part of this season in the relegation zone but have since risen to fifth in the Eredivisie table, albeit they are a massive points behind leaders PSV Eindhoven.",

      "article_body": "LONDON, Dec Reuters Vicario Guglielmo is far from the most highprofile goalkeeper in the Premier League but he is enjoying an excellent first season at Tottenham Hotspur and turned on the style on Saturday to ensure his team emerged with a win over Everton. He would have been pleased to warm his hands with three routine stops from tame Everton finishes in the first half as the visitors started their fightback after Richarlison and Son Heungmin's early goals had Spurs up. In the second half though he really had to be at his best, particularly when spectacularly foiling Arnaut Danjuma moments after Andre Gomes had pulled it back to after minutes. He also stood up strongly to the physical buffering that this muscular Everton side put every keeper through, and was a rare island of security on the ball as his defence routinely got themselves into difficulties playing out from the back. \"He has been strong pretty much from the first game,\" Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said. \"Some games we haven't needed a lot and today we did. \"The saves he made but also the way he dealt with corners was so strong they put so much pressure on the goalkeeper. \"He's a great shotstopper and is dealing with a different back four in lots of games. He's got a maturity which helps the team in those moments.\" The manager also said that he was not surprised by Richarlison's turnaround as his goal made it four in three matches having scored two in his previous . \"He's playing mate,\" he said when asked to explain the turnaround. \"He obviously missed a bit of football with his groin operation in November but he's getting stronger every game. He wasn't struggling before, he just wasn't and he was soldiering on. He just feels a bit freer now both mentally and physically. \"His general play has been really good but I know there's more to come.\" Postecoglou said there was no major issue that forced the former Everton striker off during the second half, and that the Brazilian just had a sore back. He was also impressed by the mutual respect shown between Richarlison and the , Everton fans. He applauded them as he left the pitch, and they, forever thankful for his goals that kept them up in , did the same. \"These things happen in football,\" he said. \"I don't think anyone would question his service for Everton and I think the fans appreciate that.\"",

City have won only one of their last six league games and have dropped to fourth, five points behind leaders Arsenal, but the treble winners have booked their spot in the Club World Cup final with Tuesday's over Urawa Red Diamonds. European champions City, who also won the UEFA Super Cup this year, have missed the influence of injured Belgian playmaker Kevin De Bruyne while a foot problem has denied them the services of goal machine Erling Haaland recently. While manager Pep Guardiola said De Bruyne, who has made only one league appearance this season due to a hamstring injury, has returned to training, but Haaland remains out. The duo will miss Friday's final against Brazilian side Fluminense. \"We have to give our best to try to win everything because it will be history. It would be an amazing run if we end with five titles,\" Rodri said. \"The last few games left a very bad feeling in the changing room for us, so I think it was good for us to stop a little bit and then come here to the Club World Cup. \"When you're in that moment you're in this mixture of feeling that you have failed and dropping points. It's a time when you can't speak much, you have to be quiet, work as hard as you can and results will come out.\"",

      "article_body": "LILLE, France, Dec Reuters Ligue leaders Paris Saint Germain threw away two points as they were held to a draw at Lille when substitute Jonathan David headed a lastminute equaliser after the visitors had taken the lead through a Kylian Mbappe penalty on Sunday. PSG were caught with a sucker punch when substitute Marco Asensio's sloppy pass was intercepted and although Adam Ounas's deflected shot was well saved by Arnau Tenas with his legs David followed up to nod the ball into the net on the rebound. PSG had gone in front through Mbappe's spot kick in the th minute after Bafode Diakite tripped Lucas Hernandez. The result leaves PSG with points, five clear of secondplaced Nice, who lost at Le Havre on Saturday. AS Monaco, who are third, went down at home to lowly Olympique Lyonnais on Friday. Lille's win leaves them in fourth with points. \"We hardly suffered in the first minutes but a slight lack of control and Lille's pressure meant we ended up with a draw,\" PSG manager Luis Enrique said. \"It's a shame, but you have to play matches to the last second. It's a result that doesn't necessarily do justice to the game we played, but that's the way it is.\" Lille started strongly in front of an enthusiastic home crowd and created chances initially but as the game wore on the visitors gained more control over the match. Ousmane Dembele had PSG's first clear opportunity when he was played through in the box but his attempt from a tight angle narrowly missed the target. In the minutes leading up to the break, Vitinha came close for the visitors but his attempt from close range was tipped over for a corner by Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier. PSG maintained the pressure at the beginning of the second half and went ahead when Mbappe fired his spot kick into the top corner. But there was a sting in the Lille tail for the visitors as David popped up to level the scores at the death. PSG host lowly Metz on Wednesday, while Lille travel to Strasbourg before the league shuts down for the Christmas break.",
